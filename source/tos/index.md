<h3>DON'Ts</h3>

- Repost my translations.
- Submit my translations to quote accounts or use my translations in automated bot accounts (whether itâ€™s for personal use or public).
- Use my translations to train AI or use them to create character bots.
- Use screenshots of my translations for character analysis purposes. Screenshotting a detail you find cute/funny/sad/interesting is totally fine though and I 100% encourage it ^^;

<h3>DOs</h3>

- Use my song translations for edits, as long as there is ***clear, visible credit*** either in the video or in the description.
- Use my translations to translate into another language, credit is appreciated!
- Link my translations in masterlists, a heads up in my dms/askbox is appreciated!

My translations are all for **non profit** purposes.
