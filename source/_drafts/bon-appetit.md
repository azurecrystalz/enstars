{% bubble Hiiro %}
I ordered the lightly vanilla scented "pudding a-la-mode"!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
And I got a parfait filled to the brim with seasonal fruit!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
I got this super fancy fruit waffle, and it even comes with a little parfait on the side!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
All three treats in a row make for a pretty _sweet_ sight~ All these sweets look tasty!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Just like the name of the place, “Fruit Parlor”, says, there’s a variety of different fruits on everything on the menu.

I’m unfamiliar with what a “parlor” is, but after following Shiina-san, I was able to discover beautiful food. I’m so happy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
When I go out to eat so that I can come up with new recipes, I usually go out alone. But I’m glad I let you both tag along~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Ahaha. When I heard you were coming to the Fruit Parlor, I couldn’t resist, since I’ve got a sweet tooth.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Umu. Likewise, I heard it was a good place with splendid food… There’s still so much in the city I don’t know about.
{% endbubble %}

![itadakeeee!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b667aa1ee3b8435a22bd9d8dc27d7d92/269a675dc4112e70-63/s1280x1920/2694b50527e4bb1c68bbe09d90424da4096bcb1d.png)

{% bubble Niki %}
…Oop. I’m gonna dig in now. Thank you for the meaaaal~!
{% endbubble %}

> **_Hinata + Hiiro:_** Thank you for the meal!

{% bubble Niki %}
Just so you know, a "parlor" is a Western-type restaurant that offers a bunch of casual foods and drinks.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Heeeh, I've learned something new. Thank you, Shiina-san!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Oh right, if you're gonna need a reference for a recipe, do you want a bite? Cuz this parfait is taaaasty~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Is it really okay?! I'd love to!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Please try some of my pudding as well. It's delicious, so much so that I can't think of any other way to describe it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Uuu, you two are too kind! When I finish this recipe I'll _absolutely_ let you try it...!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Fufu, I'm looking forward to it. Shiina-san always makes such delicious food.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Soooo true~ Shiina-senpai, we're lucky to be in the same room as you. Ah, that reminds me--
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
? Why did you just point your phone at me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Oh, don't mind me! While you're eating so happily like that, just turn this way a bit please!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Like this?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Ohh, I got a pretty good shot~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
What's with this all of a sudden? Are you posting it to SNS<sup>**(1)**</sup>?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
...Not exactly, I actually overheard something back at the agency. Shiina-senpai's turn for a "Feature Live" is coming up.
{% endbubble %}

![already?!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/fd35c7c1db0e517a6bd93c13ff46ebaa/269a675dc4112e70-78/s1280x1920/37e9103b168b672c9aa8272a15ab0d9d9f8ac860.png)

{% bubble Niki %}
Heeeh, my "Feature Live"...

Wait, _what?!_ It's my turn already?! But didn't Rinne-kun just have a live performance a few days ago?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
That's true, Nii-san's show was recent. However, is there a specific rule for the order?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
No clue. Anzu-san might be looking at the schedule and deciding that way?

...But let's just leave that be for a bit. The pamphlet for the "Feature Live" features a bunch of off-shots<sup>**(2)**</sup> of the idols. I thought having this fun time with Shiina-senpai was the perfect chance for an off-shot picture, so I took one~

Shiina-senpai, if you're out on your day off, that means you're "off" now, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
I guess? I mean, I'm eating food and being really random, but it isn't any different from what I do everyday... So maybe it's fine for an offshoot?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
I _know_, right? And here's....another shot~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Then, I'll do my best to take pictures of Shiina-senpai too. I've improved at using a camera recently~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Having two cameras being pointed at me feels weird, but if it really is my turn, then it would be a big help if I had a few pictures. I'd be grateful if you randomly took a few.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Umu, please leave it to us. Would it be alright to send these to Anzu-san later?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
That's right. Instead of sending them to Shiina-senpai, it'd just be faster to send them to Anzu-san first. I'll send them and explain~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Thanks a bunch, you two~

...Oh, once you're done taking pictures you should probably get back to eating. You'll miss out~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Uwah, the ice cream is gonna melt!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
That's true, we need to eat it quickly...!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Even if they’re just sweets, savor them well, you two~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
<th>*(Tomorrow's prep, check. Sweeping the restaurant and keeping the kitchen clean, check. That's pretty much it for work today, all that's left is waiting for Nee-san here--)*</th>

--Ah, Nee-san, when did you get here?! Please come in instead of staying by the door!

You didn't want to get in the way so you watched and waited for me to finish work? Nono, Nee-san, didn't you contact me beforehand? You could've just talked to me at any point with no problem, y’know.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
...So, um. About my "Feature Live", I know it's my turn for it, but what did you want to meet up for?

Eh? A picture? Oh, you're talking about the one the other two took? I'm happy you like them, it's all thanks to Hinata-kun and Otouto-san...

Is this...what I was hoping for? You're asking what kind of moments do I want to post and which off-shot pictures I think are good? Uummmm, I mean, if it's just a picture of good food then I have no problem, but it's gonna be in the pamphlet, so I have to be in the pictures, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
.....

Sorry, I should stay quiet. It's an "off-shoot", so I was just thinking about my time off...

? You're asking if I even _have_ time off, what do you mean by that?

...Of course I do, I spend it prepping food at night like this. I'm at the cafeteria or at "Cinnamon" in the kitchen when I'm not doing idol things too. But, today I used my time off to think up ideas for a new recipe.

Wait, wouldn't that count as a chef's job?
{% endbubble %}

![off?](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a10f0c22077d56db17d146858faf7348/269a675dc4112e70-e2/s1280x1920/64ea8c7d36dd4e993fbf1116eda4c9fa24410745.png)

{% bubble Niki %}
Uuu, I'm gonna go crazy. What in the world do I consider as time off?

You're asking if I don't have days off to at least tell you what I do in my spare time?

J-just wait a moment please. I'll try to figure out how I normally am!

![what is it](https://64.media.tumblr.com/19f099ff3da2e08f54f6fb68bae83903/f094a20b3c9210fb-a2/s1280x1920/39d7dd0b04c1b6f9fdaa4582ee68340f6998d3d1.png)

{% bubble Niki %}
My time off, just _what_ is it~…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}

  <th>*(I just kept Nee-san in the dark for a while, and in the end the only thing I could think of was cooking... To be fair I **did** try to think of something apart from cooking, but all I could come up with was playing mahjong and pachinko with Rinne-kun!)*</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Sigh. Being optimistic is harder than I thought...
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}

  <th>*(...Even when it came to my "personalized outfit"<sup>**(3)**</sup>. I kept talking about cooking, only because it's something I love and am interested in. I couldn't think of any ideas. This time I really want to come up with my own ideas without Nee-san's help, even if it's just a bit.)*</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
But, the more I work my brain the hungrier I get~...

Good thing I decided to make a night snack. I'll think about all this once the bowl is empty. Mogumogu.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Unknown %}
Kunkun<sup>**(4)**</sup>... What's that tasty smell?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Harukawa-kun? What are you doing here at this hour?
{% endbubble %}

![like rice](https://64.media.tumblr.com/fd064134056cefee5a2766e2c4bfb460/f094a20b3c9210fb-b6/s1280x1920/4dc3732b89d4e6a603451d2c74e2c08c83262a9b.png)

{% bubble Sora %}
Oh nothing~. But, it kind of smelled like rice so Sora found himself wandering over...?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
If you're wandering around, then surely you're hungry. Here, I made this so you're free to eat some if you want?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
HaHa~? Now that you mention it, Sora does feel a bit hungry. Could he eat together with you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Absolutely~ Just sit and wait a sec please, I'll bring it over~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
HiHi~, it's super warm and tasty! Chef Onii-san<sup>**(5)**</sup>, you make a really good cook!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Fufuuun~ That's because I _am_ a cook.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
Right now it seems like something is bothering you though, Chef Onii-san.
{% endbubble %}

![help](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c1294c45ae72ea1d825bf8c6ab2ad06c/f094a20b3c9210fb-ef/s1280x1920/c4641612d1a331457674024afa97c5376c299849.png)

{% bubble Niki %}
Mugu!? ...Ngugu, gokun!<sup>**(6)**</sup> H-how could you tell?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
Because that's what your "colors" looked like? It's hard to put into words but...
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Ohhh, Harukawa-kun, could you tell from your senses? I'm the same way, since I can tell a lot of things by smell.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
Eh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
I'm pretty sensitive to that kind of thing.

No matter how much someone disguises themselves, I can smell it out and see right through it~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
Huhu ♪. Unexpectedly, we're closer than Sora thought~? It's surprising, but it's delightful...

Sora wants to hear your story, Chef Onii-san!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
My story?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
Right~ Sora is a magician that makes everyone happy! If there's any trouble with using the magic, then he can guide them to a happier direction!

That's why, why don't you try telling Sora about what's wrong? Sora wants to help Chef Onii-san with his cooking.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
If you insist...I'm starting to feel like I want you to listen to me too. It's a silly personal problem of mine, but I want you to listen and keep this between you and me. So--
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
   <p>A few minutes later.</p>
</div>

{% bubble Niki %}
...And so, I don't know what my time off is!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
So that's what's wrong~ Chef Onii-san, you're lost on what your off time is?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
That's right. When I have time off, when I'm not working as an idol or in the kitchen...I've thought about it so much, but everything I do is for cooking: eating out, thinking up of a recipe, and going abroad to find new ingredients.

Even "Niki's Kitchen" is a Circle based on cooking. With the "Overnight Outdoor's Club" too, I was in charge of cooking. Everything just comes back to cooking...! I'm buried from head to toe in food!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
Chef Onii-san, you really like to cook...

No, you really, really, _really_ love cooking, don't you~? Sora thought it was amazing, so what would be wrong with it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Because, if all I can think up of is cooking, then no matter how you look at it that's not an idea, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
Not at all! You love it so much that you never get sick of it, you think about it everyday and get carried away with it. It's wonderful to keep constantly exploring something~

That's why, we should show that love to everyone. It would make you happy if you showed that "love" to others...wouldn't it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
...It wouldn't make a difference.

Thank you, Harukawa-kun. It's my call now...so I'll think about it for just a bit longer~

Now? I'm finishing everything up, it'll be ready soon~

...Yep, perfect. Nee-san, I'm sure this'll suit your tastes~

Ah, that's right. Could you take a picture of me now? For the pamphlet's offshots...

How do I look? "Well, like a cook"?--

That's right, I'm both an idol and a cook.

I was thinking about that for a while, but then I thought, if all I could think of was cooking, I'd just make one ingredient called food.

That picture you just took is of me and food. It's a different taste than the picture of me eating sweets the day before, right? My facial expression changes depending on the kind of food I make and eat.

No matter what, I love cooking. I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea for my fans to see me like that, but...what do you think?

....? "Sounds like you, but it's going to make for one hungry pamphlet"?

Nyahaha. It really _would_ make people hungry if all they saw was pictures of me and my food, right? But, that's all I've got.

Please give the pamphlet a read, and get as excited as you can for the live--I'll perform a live that will make the dinner after the show taste even better!

Well then, thank you for waiting. For lunch today is my very own special, a lunch plate with a side of sweets~

I want to think about everything together while we eat. About a "Feature Live" that will leave everyone full and satisfied...~

<!-- Translation Notes -->

<h4>Translation Notes</h4>

(1): An abbreviation meaning “Social Networking Sites”, social media basically

(2): Hinata calls them off-shots in the dialogue box written in ktkn. The idea of it described in other FS2 stories is that the pamphlet needs candid (in the moment) pictures of idols in their free time.

(3): Referring to his FS1 story. Anzu helped completely with the design.

(4): JP onomatopoeia for “sniff sniff” like taking a short whiff of something.

(5): I think this is the first time Sora has interacted with Niki so for anyone editing the wiki this is the nickname used!

(6): Choking noises, written exactly as shown in the dialogue box (・・；)
