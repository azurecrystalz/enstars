<th>_(This all started out with a letter...I got it out of the blue a couple of days ago. All it said was "I have something important to tell you" and to meet in front of the museum today. The chances of this all being a prank aren't impossible, but it's weird that I'm the only person being called here to this museum.)_</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
I've got no clue who it is, but if I've come all the way out here I'd like to see who--
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Unknown %}
Ah, I found you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Eh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
--Ya-ho, Kohaku-kun. Thank you for coming today.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
N-Nagisa-han? If you're calling for me, then the one that invited me here....
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
...Was me.
{% endbubble %}

![special exhibit](https://64.media.tumblr.com/93db83958fdb58f25688b2d93561dba8/a3e3fe1cea7d4e19-5c/s2048x3072/835ee41ff97a7b32c48a0a97a0b25a53eefa5455.png)

{% bubble Nagisa %}
....There's a special exhibit for ores and fossils happening in the museum now. I was looking for someone to accompany me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
...While I was thinking of who, I decided you'd be best since I've shared rocks with you before<sup>**(1)**</sup>.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Thanks a lot for that. But Nagisa-han, I'm not the only one that's gotten rocks from you before right? Bon also said he's gotten one from you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
...I suppose. However your schedule is also the easiest to follow. I can just ask Ibara.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Well, that's the Vice President for you. So then, what's the "important thing" you wanted...?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
...I'd like you to accompany me in understanding how this ancient earth works through ores and fossils.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
? Why?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
...I believe it'd be easier to see the exhibit than to explain. Let's go inside, shall we?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
S-sure.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}

<th>_(I haven't got the **slightest** clue how to respond! Is it really okay to be following him like this...?!)_</th>
{% endbubble %}

![what](https://64.media.tumblr.com/44ff4d17e3b46fded0b31fc6236e82c4/a3e3fe1cea7d4e19-48/s2048x3072/ed8a62ce01f412cc20dc87179108e8f8083a7322.png)

{% bubble Kohaku %}
...Wh-what in the _world?_ There are huge bones hanging from the ceiling...!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
...What's wrong? Could it be that the skeletal display surprised you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Isn't being surprised a _normal_ reaction when something this big is dangling in front of you?! Th-those...aren't _real_ bones right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
...Well it's a replica, so not really. However these displays' shapes and sizes are meant to get as close as possible to the real thing...same for the colors. Paint is used to show the texture.
{% endbubble %}

![unblm](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9dcd2a2655998a4d096a399a6cbd27b0/a3e3fe1cea7d4e19-92/s2048x3072/ab66a51eec1931316beb42f64932e8c6ce05c23d.png)

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Waaa, it's well made. Everywhere I look there's strange things I haven't seen before...I can't even think of what this is used for.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
....Kohaku-kun, is this your first time visiting a museum?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Yeah, I've never had connections to this kind of place. I remember you mentioned before how the "Antique Market" was kinda like a museum<sup>**(2)**</sup>. I think that was just limited to telling the history of idols.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
...That's right, but that carries its own value. This here is what a real museum is like...The lineage of Earth and humanity's history and art is all collected, kept, and displayed openly for the public to see

...It's with these exhibits that we learn about the evolution of mankind and the earth...Of course, coming for fun is acceptable as well.

Kohaku-kun, is there anything that you wanted to see?

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
That _I_ wanted to see?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
...While I was talking to you, I noticed you seemed to be looking around you more. So I was wondering if something had caught your eye.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Umm. Not really, how do I put this.

I...feel like I'm lost in a strange world. So I'm just looking around me because I don't know where else to look. It's kinda like being lost in a place where you don't understand a single thing around you, yknow...?

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
...This museum, it's probably completely unfamiliar to you isn't it Kohaku-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Like I was saying, I haven't got any connections to this place. I never did much studying <sup>**(3)**</sup>, so I don't really get what the meaning of all this history is...When I ran out into the world and became an idol, I thought my worldview had gotten just a bit bigger.

But when it comes to going to a _specific_ place, I'm lost all over again. I know learning is a part of life, but I know that whatever I've learned is still only a little bit.

{% endbubble %}

![same as me](https://64.media.tumblr.com/58a3252cc7b38392c0e822ec49c802ff/a3e3fe1cea7d4e19-41/s2048x3072/a4d8be17851e8fe6feabc52a8dde02bf5cae933a.png)

{% bubble Nagisa %}
...You're the same as me, Kohaku-kun. I personally grow by absorbing knowledge and information everyday.

But, there's also some fun to be had when tackling things that are unknown to you. Recently for me, it's been cooking.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Cooking? Nagisa-han?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
....Yes. Once I learned how to buy ingredients, my worldview broadened. I found more fun and interesting things...

Kohaku-kun, I think your worldview will continue to widen.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
My worldview...
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
...As of now, your vision is still only partially open.

With a desire to dive in, chase, and push forward--that tenacity will bring to you an unseen future.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
I guess you're right...I still don't know about idol culture or sense, and I still don't know my left from my right...

But as long as there's the freedom to, then I might just meet something like that just like you said, Nagisa-han~

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
...Fufu. Then, shall we see what you want to see and follow your sense of interest?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Eh, why? I thought you wanted to come here for the special exhibit?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
Finding something you're interested in and gaining some new insight today would be the most important reason for coming to the museum. Fortunately, the temporary exhibit is still open for a longer period of time, so I can come again another time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Are you sure? But, when I look at the map I can't tell anything...
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
...Then how about we go to the exhibit in the basement? There's space for even bigger skeletal and biological conservation models down there.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Really? They've got bones that are bigger than _that?_

Uuuummm, now that you've said it, I _am_ kind of curious...

First we can start with that exhibit room so that we can learn the history and eras.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
...It's just around the corner down the stairs.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Got it. Let's get going...~

<!-- Translation Notes -->
<h4>Translation Notes</h4>

(1): Referring to Kohaku's FS1 story which I've tled [here](https://azurecrystalz.github.io/2050/05/24/sakura-sakura/)! Nagisa gives Kohaku some amber.

(2): Referring to the conversation Kohaku and Nagisa had in one of the middle chapters of Antique Legend.

(3): Meaning “I never [had schooling/went to school]”, but I didn't want to stray from the dialogue.
