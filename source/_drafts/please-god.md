{% bubble Rinne %}
Hey, Hiyori-chan~! It’s great to see ya! I can’t really tell why, but seeing Hiyori-chan feels like a good sign. Must be the benefits of your “ii-hiyori”<sup>**(1)**</sup>♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Rinne-senpai, I know you must be absolutely in tears at the sight of me, but right now it’s “warui hiyori”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Nn? Why? You don’t look too good, did you catch cold?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
I came here to pick up a nice snack, but the quiche I was looking for is sold out.

I was the one that sent the letter suggesting that quiche should be added to their “repertoire”. The fact that I can’t eat it is unforgivable.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Oioi, you like eating tissues<sup>**(2)**</sup>? You’re like a goat eating paper.

Hiyori-chan try saying “meh-meh”♪

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
I will absolutely _not_ say that, and I am _not_ a goat! I am in no mood to be made fun of, got it? Why are you provoking me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
I had some free time and I saw a friend of mine, so is there an issue if I wanna go talk to them?

We’re roommates, so why don’t you play nice with me a bit? Gyahaha!

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Roommates...Well then, why don’t you go ask Kanata-kun to play with you? He’s definitely not as lucky as me, but he’s got some good luck as well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
What do you mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
This is just hearsay, but I heard that while he was attending Yumenosaki Academy he was worshipped by the students for granting them anything they wished for.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
"Anything", you say? Gyaha! There’s no way. What is he, a god?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Fufu. Whether you believe it or not is up to you, Rinne-senpai.

Sorry to keep you waiting~, here are both of your daily specials.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Thank you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Hey, Niki-han. I’ve got something I need to ask you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Oukawa.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Isn’t it bothering you too, HiMERU-han? There’s no getting anywhere by ourselves, so let’s get Niki-han in on it.

Um, right over there…that’s Rinne-han sitting at the counter, isn’t it?

{% endbubble %}

![ha](https://64.media.tumblr.com/03e1c7489d13a13aff1ed662c43164b4/de82d7849d1301c7-71/s2048x3072/a97f49ce42dbfd52a9ef7d2658bd1acd8c98b717.png)

{% bubble Rinne %}
...

...haa...

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
He looks like he’s been mulling over something like that for a really long time, did something happen? Maybe he ate something weird?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Ehh, please don’t accuse me of putting something in his food!

I was wondering why he wasn’t in our hair, but now that you point it out he _has_ been a little different.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
So that means even Shiina doesn’t know.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
HiMERU-han, where are you going?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
To ask him directly. It’s a waste if we all sit here talking about it while not knowing anything.

Amagi, a moment please?

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
…Hey, Merumeru. Do you believe in God?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Hah?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Crap, Rinne-han’s broken.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Uwah, this is trouble. Who can fix him? Otouto-san?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
I’m not broken, I’m fine.

I’ve got no idea how or why, but after I prayed to Kana-cchi, I kept hitting it big in every pachinko game I played. At first it was all just some kind of joke, but I really think that he could be some kind of gambling god.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
I’ll have to treasure this kind of luck~! Gyahaha!
{% endbubble %}

  <div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Even more days later.</p>
  </div>

{% bubble Hiyori %}
I’m baaack! If you’re home you’d better give me a big warm welcome!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Welcome back, “Ohisama”-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Kanata-kun, what’s wrong? I’m back now, so how could you look so down?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
I’m feeling “fine”, I’m just confused. “Chief”-san has been extravagantly spoiling me lately.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Spoiling you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Yes. He bought me an “inflatable pool” and he tried taking me to a "seafood" restaurant.

I don’t understand his true “intentions”. It’s really troubling.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Ah, I have an idea why that is, let me tell you…
{% endbubble %}

  <div class="msr-narration">
    <p>After a few moments.</p>
  </div>

{% bubble Hiyori %}
And that’s it. He sounds like he really believes that buying you more gifts will increase his luck.

I would even say he actually thinks of you as a gambling deity.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Fumu, so that’s why he was acting like a “suck up”.

I don’t like it, the feeling of being used you know?

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Rinne: I’m back~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Ah, “Chief”-san. I need to tell you something.

I’m not a “gambling god”, you know that right?

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Aah…haha. Did you catch me praying to you this whole time?

Wish I'd heard that a little earlier, since I just lost big time. Haa, there really is no such thing as a quick-deal in this world.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Don’t huff in my presence! If you won’t worship Kanata-kun, then you can worship me!

I am part of “Eden”, named after the haven dominated by an all-powerful God, so treating me with reverence will _surely_ bring you some blessings!

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
No way♪, could you be pushing your beliefs onto me? What should Rinne-kun do now~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
There’s no harm in trying! I’ll have a bronze statue sculpted of me, so that you can go to worship it everyday.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Hehe, Hiyori-sama~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
I don’t like your tone! Be serious, and show some more respect!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Jeez. This god’s got too many demands.
{% endbubble %}

<!-- Translation Notes -->

<h4>Translation Notes</h4>

(1): For anyone that needs the explanation: it's a pun of sorts made on Hiyori's name to describe if he finds something good or bad.

(2): Rinne interpreted Hiyori incorrectly and heard “tisshu” (meaning tissue) instead of “qisshu” (meaning quiche).
