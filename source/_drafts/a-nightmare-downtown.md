  {% bubble Niki %}
    Mogumogu...~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Ugh… Niki-han, how are you even able to eat crepes after eating so many pancakes…The more I look at it, the more my heart burns.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![crepes](https://64.media.tumblr.com/90392c2d668540802a2e3ac858c7d8b7/bd02ee6f71565a1a-50/s2048x3072/a0283b12c93e6a8daf194343c5eb19220df6c37a.pnj)

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Oh no, what're you saying, Kohaku-chan? Didn't you know? Crepes are the very definition of "sweets are for a separate stomach"<sup>**(1)**</sup>, they're a groundbreaking sweet treat.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Hm?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Take a peek at this crepe. Look how thin it is.
    
    It could totally fit as much space as possible in a stomach that just seems full. Mogumogu...~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    What's with that explanation? It makes way too much sense.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Oh, Niki. A bug just landed on your crepe. I'll shoo it off for you, so just give it here.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Eh? I couldn't catch sight of anything, so is that true? Uuuun, I don't see any bugs…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Nono. Niki, you just aren't looking right. I asked you to give it to me because there's a little trick to finding them.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Eh? Well, if you're really insisting that much—here.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Whereeee is it~?
    
    Here~? Mogumogu…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Ah! What are you *doing?!*
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Mogumogu… gulp—what is it, Niki? I'm working really hard to find these bugs for you right now.
    
    Nn…I might've been wrong when I thought I saw a bug land on it, so I'll give it back now. This is really good.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![how dare](https://64.media.tumblr.com/86b6cd0c7f9899fe8d2ce9ce551790ad/bd02ee6f71565a1a-a5/s2048x3072/d1370ce8a91bb14b052be67b4ff4de4da6a9c18c.pnj)

  {% bubble Niki %}
    My crepe! How dare you, how dare you, how dare you, how dare you, how dare you, how *dare you…!*<sup>**(2)**</sup>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    It's *fiiine*, it was just a bite. Don't get so worked up over something so small, Niki.
    
    It's like you always say, "Good food tastes good alone but tastes even better with others". You got to share your food with me in the end, so you should be happy.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    You say that, but you took a huge bite! If you wanted to take a bite so badly then why didn't you just say so to begin with?!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Nooope~! I was just looking for bugs!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    What are you, an elementary schooler!? How dare you tell a lie like that?!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    …Haa, you're on your own.
    
    —Eh? Come to think of it, HiMERU-han's been gone for a while now…?
    
    Ah, he's behind there. He escaped because those two were making a racket didn't he? Smart move.
    
    HiMERU-han. Isn't it cruel to escape by yourself?
  {% endbubble %}

  ![oukawa](https://64.media.tumblr.com/bfe1e596a99afba4f56083866db17d59/bd02ee6f71565a1a-4c/s2048x3072/f5208297d3370d371c6e0b70c561740f9b5d1b7e.pnj)

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —Ah, Oukawa. Apologies, HiMERU couldn't stand being seen with those two anymore…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    What, so it's fine if *I'm* seen with them?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    That's not it…Understood. From now on, Oukawa can join and we'll evacuate together.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Right, right. Honesty is always the best policy.
    
    Anyway, HiMERU-han, you look like you bought a whole bunch of cookies from that cafe earlier.
    
    Is that what you wanted to get so badly? And yesterday you mentioned something about circumstances?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Ah, these? They're meant to be a gift of gratitude for someone that assisted HiMERU with work. Aside from the pancakes, the pastries were also very popular, so he thought they'd suffice.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Of gratitude? If you wanted to give them that kind of gift, then they didn't have to be from that cafe, did they? You can get sweets from anywhere.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    No, it's *because* they can be found anywhere that these small things make a difference in testing one's sense of style.
    
    By sending a meaningful gift, one will leave a lasting impression and the gift receiver will enjoy it more.
    
    It may seem like something small, but it's the accumulation of such small things that will form the impression HiMERU makes. It's because of this that he can't afford to make any errors.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Hm. I get it now. HiMERU-han is always so perfect, I should learn a thing or two from you—
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Hey! Kohaku-chan, HiMERU-kun, I don't want you two leaving me! I mean, don't leave me here with this tyrant!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Gyahaha! Niki-kyuuun, I won't let you gooo~
    
    Me and you are *inseeeeperable*, aren't we~?
  {% endbubble %}

  ![heavy](https://64.media.tumblr.com/6ba7dbdf6c70cb369bf58460a48b84f5/bd02ee6f71565a1a-fc/s2048x3072/ee3d639f625910999c0e936f584e4857bc2cec6d.pnj)

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Gyah! Don't jump on me! You're heavy, so I'll be crushed~!
    
    Help me, Kohaku-chan, HiMERU-kun!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Even though we're trying to avoid Rinne-han and Niki-han, they're still coming at us at high speed. What are we gonna do, HiMERU-han?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —Haaa…HiMERU really regrets being here now.
  {% endbubble %}

<h4>Translation Notes</h4>

(1): I think Niki is talking about when people say they have “dessert stomachs”, which is like basically having extra room for dessert.

(2): In some cases “yokumo” is used as an adverb to describe a feeling of shock but here I think it's used as a demand here which is why I decided to translate it that way

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    C'mon, pick up the pace~. We're almost there.
    
    Aren't we, like, super behind schedule? Seriously, why is it taking so long for us to get there?
  {% endbubble %}

  ![if you dont](https://64.media.tumblr.com/2968c468777157228c0415a5819d2eee/063b3da4fa88a0bd-f6/s2048x3072/26dc8eb546bb0f4cebce56274e6f07b7dfcde92c.pnj)

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    If you don't know who's the number one reason for that, then HiMERU would be impressed.
    
    Amagi, you kept taking detours and fooling around with HiMERU and the others, so that was likely what caused the delay.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    What a pain. The distance from the cafe to the arcade really isn’t that far.
    
    Ah. Speaking of, I think I saw the building with the arcade.
    
    Nn? By the way, I haven't seen any signs of Kohaku-chan for a while?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    .....
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Whoops. He was right behind me~ He was being so quiet I didn't even realize it.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    .........
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Kohaku-chan? Can you hear me?
  {% endbubble %}

  ![ah](https://64.media.tumblr.com/742e9da6953006d939c2db058fd1661d/063b3da4fa88a0bd-6a/s2048x3072/cbe2f74f9f2db38bb4f49aa21d0df71eed23cdb7.pnj)

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    ! A-ah… sorry, I was just a little spaced out.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Umm… Kohaku-chan, I don't know what's wrong but… are you alright?
    
    We're almost at the arcade. If you don't want to do this—
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Niki-han, what are you talking about? I'm fine. I'm the same as I've always been.
    
    Yupyup. My heart's always as calm as the wind. That's how it's always been, and today's not any different. Koh-koh-koh~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Uuun. If you say so, Kohaku-chan, then it's fine…but you seriously don't have to push yourself too hard.
    
    It's just one of Rinne-kun's ideas after all. He wants our attention, so he's been trying to pull us into his plans.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Exactly. Like I said, I'm not pushing myself.
    
    Aah! I'm really excited for it! C'mon, let's go!
  {% endbubble %}

  ![here](https://64.media.tumblr.com/83216b2aad749e1d7f47d85d967476b8/063b3da4fa88a0bd-4e/s2048x3072/cc2e6bbd779636617682666b821d07e919432205.pnj)

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    …Here it is. That's the haunted house…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Ohh~… It's more serious than I'd thought it'd be. Since it's in an arcade, I thought it'd be more kids-sized.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    It's said that the haunted house is small, but they were aiming for realism. They even asked a famous haunted house producer to work on it.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    ! J-Just now, did you hear a scream coming from inside there?
    
    Ah, there it is again!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    A lot of screams can be heard from inside.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Ohhh. Their reputation is the real deal, that's great. I took time to come all the way out here on my day off. It'd be boring if a haunted house wasn't scary.
    
    Everyone got their tickets~? C'mon, c'mon. Let's go ♪
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —Understood. Please don't push, Amagi. Finding solid footing is uncertain since it’s so dark.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    I know that a lot of these haunted houses have jumpscares and stuff~
    
    I'm not scared, but I don't want to get jumpscared and use up energy. I'll just get hungry again.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Ah. H-hang on a sec—
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    <th>*(What's with those guys...! Aren't they scared at all?! Are their hearts made of steel?! So that's why they don't have any sense of tact! I get it now!)*</th>
    
    <th>*(Everyone's already gone in so fast, I need to catch up… it's okay. We'll be in and out in a flash! It'll only take a second, and then it'll be over. I'll beeee fiiiiiiine!)*</th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    <th>*(Augh… it's pitch black! I've never heard of anything like this before. It's much darker than I expected! Even the zashikirou I was in was **way** better than this!?)*</th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Scaaaary! It's pitch black. If a ghost was to pop out of a place like this, Rinne-kun would be *soooo* frightened~!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    You say that…but Rinne-kun, you don't look scared one bit.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Shiina doesn't look that scared either.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    I'm more scared of going hungry than ghosts.
    
    Ah, actually, ghosts don't look like they have anywhere to eat, so that part is kinda scary.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Unbelievable. Shiina, are you going to eat the ghosts too?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}

    <th>*(My eyes are getting used to the dark too. I'll make it to the end in no time. I think I was just a little nervous because it's a foreign place for me, but I wasn't scared. This is a so-called haunted house, but this is nothing~)*</th>

    ......Ummm.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    HiMERU thought he'd lose his lunch…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    I somehow found myself sticking out of the floorboards too…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    …Augh. My body, it feels like it's bent at an angle it shouldn't be. Can anyone see it?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    E-everyone, sorry… I just got a liiiiitle surprised~…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    It can't be. The cause of shock wasn’t the ghosts inside, but Oukawa right beside us… We were blindsided.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Kohaku-chan's fists would be thrown whenever he was jumpscared by a ghost~ Even a skilled fighter would turn pale, that was a crazy barrage.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![an accident](https://64.media.tumblr.com/f5b126a44b9b72b6ac9961262da801e0/324aa61c16ce22f9-22/s2048x3072/06806ca28abc5a95c9471dc4eab02b9418257ba9.pnj)

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    That was…um…that was an accident…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    That's no good, that's just no *good!* At this rate, our "ES Halloween" attendance is *seriously* gonna be in danger!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    You're not wrong. If he was to go bonkers every time he's jumpscared then there's a chance he'd just do that theday of the event too~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —Also, at this rate, the live performance may be impeded.
    
    This year the event is supposed to be made with attention to realistic details, after all. HiMERU doesn't suppose our costumes will be an exception to that.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    There's no way you're expecting me to react like *that* at the live…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Really? What's to say our costumes *aren't* gonna be like the ones in the haunted house?
    
    Are you gonna be able to keep a cool head when you're surrounded by a bunch of ghosts? Can you promise that you're gonna perform like normal?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Th-that's…well…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Alright! In that case, we'll do some special training! No matter what motif or stage comes our way, we're gonna help you out, Kohaku-chan!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Hah?! Special training...?!
  {% endbubble %}

  ![jeez](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e067ba62144a731402c48f2c825852c5/324aa61c16ce22f9-e8/s2048x3072/1296ecc9ee7b4ef700bea3f796252dcde39d18e4.pnj)

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Jeez… why was I pulled into this mess…
    
    Not only that, I don’t care if you call it training, but staying at ES to tell stories is ridiculous! This is all for Rinne-han’s amusement, so why do I have to be put through all this…?!
    
    You think so too, right, Niki-han?!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Unn…Uuuunnnn…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Hey, are you even listening to me Niki-han?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Ah, just wait a sec! I’m trying to seriously think of what kind of snacks I wanna bring with me here.
    
    Ummumumum…this is such a life or death matter~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    What’s with you and your worrying. If you really can’t choose, then isn’t it okay to choose both?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Aren’t you a genius, Kohaku-chan?! You’re right! When in doubt, I can just take it all!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    You were wondering which of these two to pick from, but why exactly did you need to bring all this?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Even if I picked from these two, I was still gonna struggle with picking which sweets to bring. But, if I take everything with me, then I'm not gonna have that issue anymore!

    So! What's up? Didn't you want to say something earlier?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    As I was *saying*…I don't get why we're getting pulled along Rinne-han's whims so easily.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Nyaha, that's true. Well, Rinne-kun offered me dinner so that's why I went with it~.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    He said that he'd feed you, but Niki-han, aren't you the one that makes the food anyways? That's just being competent.

    Nono, the issue is the cost of everything, not the fact that I'm making the food. Rinne-kun said he'd cover that for me!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    I'm sure he's just gonna use "Crazy:B"s funds or whatever else he can get his hands on to cover that.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    If I can eat a big full meal for free, then I'll follow you anywhere, no matter what it takes~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Niki-han… Don't go being lured away now, ok? And don't go following some stranger either.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Nyaha. Don't expect me to be that greedy~ I would never, Kohaku-chan.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    That's not very convincing…
    
    Now then, since you've got all of your snacks and stuff ready, let's go to the practice room. I'm pretty sure Rinne-han and HiMERU-han are getting it ready.
    
    Actually, how did we get permission to stay here at ES anyway? It's unusual.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Rinne-kun went and talked to the Vice President and got special permission. I have no idea how he managed to convince him, but now that we have the permission, can't we sit and train for "ES Halloween"?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Fuu~un. I'm amazed at the fact that Rinne-han managed to convince the Vice President.
    
    Actually, why are we even training to begin with! I told him tons of times, I'm not scared. If I'm caught a little off guard, then a defensive instinct kicks up and my fists lash out. It's just a natural reaction.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Kohaku-chan, why are you so scared of monsters—I mean… why do you have that defensive instinct?
    
    I'm actually surprised… I didn't think you'd be bothered by that kind of thing.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    ......
    
    It's not that I'm scared, but maybe I'm so hypersensitive because of the time I spent in the zashikirou.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Zashikirou? Well, just hearing about it *does* make it seem kind of scary.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    That's not it. It's not the place itself.
    
    When I was in my zashikirou, my only way to connect to the outside world was the internet. So I was always surfing the net.
    
    One day, I'd wandered onto a popular occult forum. All the threads there were full of disturbing faces…my instincts just knew I was in the wrong place…but then a huge tragedy happened.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Tr-tragedy…?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    All my instincts told me to close the browser, but I couldn’t really help but look around.
    
    Then, there it was, a bunch of horrifying stories.
    
    There was one about a monster that took the form of a 2-meter tall woman<sup>**(3)**</sup>, and another about a seance that would happen if you played hide-n-seek alone<sup>**(4)**</sup>. Then there was an entire story about a vacant station that nobody knew anything about<sup>**(5)**</sup>.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Ohhh, so that's what you meant by "tragedy". So you saw it and got scared?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Arrgh. Niki-han, don't you think it’s bad?! You *idiot!* All of these ghost stories take place in old-style Japanese houses or the countryside!
    
    Niki-han, do you even *understand* what it's like to read those kinds of stories in such a low light place?! You just don't get it!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    That's…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    <th>*(If it was that scary, then you really didn't have to see it…that's what I think…is this what they mean when they say "curiosity killed the cat"?)*</th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    This talk. If Rinne-han was to find out about it, there's no way he wouldn't make fun of me. So keep it hush.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Nyaha. I won't say anything~. It's gonna be me and Kohaku-chan's secret!
  {% endbubble %}

  <!-- Translation Notes -->

<h4>Translation Notes</h4>

  (3): Kohaku here I think is talking about “Hachishakusama”, a Japanese horror myth about an 8ft tall ghost woman dressed in a white hat and dress that abducts children. It's a little confusing because I'm not sure if 2-meters=8ft but it's the closest thing I could think of off the top of my head.

  (4): What Kohaku is talking about here is more familiar to me. He's talking about “Hitori Kakurenbo”, literally meaning “Lone Hide-n-Seek”. The general idea of it is that it's a ritual set up involving a ghost possessing a doll/stuffed animal, and you play hide-n-seek with that spirit. If you win then you survive, if not then the spirit possesses/kills you. Fun. 

  (5): If Kohaku here is talking about “Kisaragi Eki” then I think this is just a basic horror legend that surfaced in 2005(?) about a woman that takes a train and arrives at an empty train station (Kisaragi Station) that with no known activity and had no record of its existence. The story was told through an online comment thread somewhere but I'm pretty sure it's a famous story and there's movies made on it.
