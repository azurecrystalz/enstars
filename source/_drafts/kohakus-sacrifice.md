  # Chapter 7

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    We're back. Just like you asked, here’s drinks and snacks.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![okae](https://64.media.tumblr.com/765794b4f7498b24d682cb85a0703de3/fbaa7f6dcd2d3066-4c/s2048x3072/434c9ae264160d6b9f1ef279a1f7b4fb701b7b1d.pnj)

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Ohh. Welcome back, thanks for the hard work. We're just about done here too. All I gotta do is just put down these candles and—
    
    There.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Woah. What *is* all this? You definitely went above and beyond with preparing everything. Where did you even get these futons?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Amagi went and got them from the Vice President's room. You’d think telling 100 stories would just be some late night chit-chat, but for it to end up going this far…
    
    —Amagi. The use of fire is strictly prohibited here. Candles or anything of the like would surely cause trouble, no?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    It’s fiiiiine. These candles are LEDs, not real. If you blow on it there’s even a sensor that picks it up, and the candle will go out!
    
    Surely if we do something we gotta do it right~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Don’t only be motivated at a time like this…it’s awful.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Go on. This is the practice room we use frequently, so there’s nothing to be particularly scared of.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Ah. Merumeru, are you *suuuure* about that? Watch this. If I put the light out like so—
  {% endbubble %}

  ![wdyt](https://64.media.tumblr.com/cfc6802a6bc63c98daee020a3701617c/fbaa7f6dcd2d3066-c1/s2048x3072/ba01d8d315d5f518cea5660d083d1b7a30c2284b.pnj)

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    What do you think of this! Isn’t this great? It’s the perfect setting for telling ghost stories, isn’t it?
    
    This training is definitely gonna be good. Right, Kohaku-chan?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Ugh…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    <th>*(Th-that’s true. Up until a few minutes ago, I was doing just fine. Then the second the lights went out, this place turned into that way it was “just like then”<sup>**(1)**</sup>…!)*</th>
    
    <th>*(Are we **seriously** going to tell 100 stories in a place like **this**? There’s tons of stories about people getting into trouble when telling horror stories like this for laughs, so why on earth are **we** doing it?)*</th>
    
    <th>*(Not to mention, why do we have to be in the dark? It wouldn’t make a difference if we were in the light. Aren’t we living in an era of innovation? Wouldn’t it be so much better if we told 100 stories in a nice, bright room with BGM and light sticks waving around?!)*</th>
  {% endbubble %}

  ![senses sharp](https://64.media.tumblr.com/beeb210ebf8fc6e3bcc30890e8c9a8c4/fbaa7f6dcd2d3066-46/s2048x3072/98ab1268dcc797ec1a3c5c2971e67e6abb85e42f.pnj)

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    <th>*(Ah. Being in the dark made my senses sharper. I can sense things more than usual…! Usually I wouldn’t even spare these things much of my attention. But I can even smell tasty food around…)*</th>
    
    <th>*(Nn? Wait, isn’t it weird that I’m smelling something tasty? We’re in a pretty big building, after all. If I’m not hallucinating, then where is it coming from…?)*</th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    …~ *(Happily getting a large dinner ready)*
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Grrah! Niki, Rinne-kun over here is trying real hard to make the perfect setting for telling ghost stories, and you’re ruining the mood!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Owowowowow!? Quit putting me in a headlock~!?
    
    B-Besides, Rinne-kun, didn’t you say it would be okay to eat a good dinner~? That’s why I gave it my best effort to make all this!?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    There’s a *limit* to what you’re supposed to do! What the hell even *is* all this?! We’re not in a buffet!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    There’s sandwiches, onigiri, soup, pizza as well as dumplings, fried chicken, and french fries. Even cakes and jellies too…
    
    All of this lined up really does make it look like a buffet.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Like I said~ I’m more scared of going hungry than of ghosts. That’s why I have to make sure everything is all set for dinner. I would be terrified if I went hungry in the middle of the night…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    ……
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    <th>*(Hm? They’re acting like normal, so I don’t feel as scared as I did before.)*</th>
    
    <th>*(I can do this…! At this rate, making it to the end is doable…! I’ll make it through this no matter what it takes! I’ll get through today so that I can make it to a beautiful tomorrow!)*</th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    …<i>(Gulps)</i>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    —It couldn’t have been the manager or anyone else in the staff. So, just who was the guy that I saw at “Cinnamon”…?
    
    I wonder if it had anything to do with the high fever I had for three days after that. I still have no idea. That’s where my story stops.
    
    Ah, hm? What’s wrong? You guys suddenly went quiet.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    You, the hell are you on about?! You’re in a position where you said something weird and everyone else says “No way, that’s not true”!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Eeeh?! You’re the one that asked me to tell a horror story so I did~!?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    That horror story was the most genuine. Especially because of the fact that it’s in a setting that’s familiar to us, so it made it more realistic.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Seriously. Niki’s such a bastard~
    
    Nn? Ah, it’s already getting really late so I’m gonna take a quick break. We’ve still got the whole night ahead of us.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    You’re still up for it, Amagi? HiMERU, for one, would like to get some rest.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Don’t be such a loner, Merumeru~
  {% endbubble %}

  ![mario-coin-sound-effect](https://64.media.tumblr.com/1438458bbc828f6cad6fdaae6f654edf/fbaa7f6dcd2d3066-a0/s2048x3072/71095f4e259a78b244c12a98cf238063049c791b.pnj)

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Please don’t latch onto HiMERU. It’s irritating.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Augh… My stomach is at it’s limit since I’ve been up this long…!
    
    At this rate I’m gonna die, and I’ll be the ghost here~…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Shiina. Don’t fall onto the tile. If you’re going to collapse anywhere, at least fall onto one of the futons.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    <th>*(Niki-han was the one I thought I could listen to without any worries! That **traitooor!** …What am I gonna do now? I have to use the bathroom…)*</th>
  {% endbubble %}

  ![secretly looks](https://64.media.tumblr.com/83a6c5ddd175d6531cc0b16f573be979/fbaa7f6dcd2d3066-81/s2048x3072/66cd828c4fff9911cb6f3234d4b8a791e2098e8a.pnj)

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    …<i>(Secretly looks around)</i>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    <th>*(Rinne-han is definitely gonna make fun of me, no way.)*</th>
    
    <th>*(Niki-han is…uuum. He wouldn’t make fun of me but he’d prioritize his food, I can’t count on him. I’m also holding a grudge against him for what happened before.)*</th>
    
    <th>*(HiMERU-han really is the only one I can ask here…)*</th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Good grief. How the two of you are the eldest but are still managing to put yourselves in this kind of mess is unbelievable.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    *(whispering)* HiMERU-han.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Hm? What’s wrong, Oukawa?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    U-umm…I need to use the bathroom…
    
    HiMERU-han, could you…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    ……
    
    Ah, just when HiMERU was thinking he could use a break. Could he come with you, Oukawa?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    …! Yeah! Let’s go together~<sup>**(2)**</sup>
  {% endbubble %}

<h4>Translation Note</h4>

(1): I had a little trouble translating this part, but in case there’s clarification needed he’s talking about what he told Niki last chapter. The setting to him feels like the time he discovered the forum in his zashikirou.

(2): Kohaku has used this exact type of dialogue line to HiMERU before during mainsto! HiMERU big brother instict kicked in I think :3

  # Chapter 8
  ***
  ![you did](https://64.media.tumblr.com/fe11238a60c46b29ab05bf36f29fa4e6/19d33e9ecfaf3ae2-8f/s2048x3072/80ff68684e809f52f6e8b7914ac6e2bac283334a.pnj)

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Uwah?! Just now, did I just hear a clanking sound?!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    You did. It was likely the temperature and humidity that caused the place to rumble.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Aah…is that so? The place rumbling huh…
    
    Is this wrong? It's normal for someone to get scared by any weird noises that happen suddenly.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —Agreed. HiMERU thinks it's normal as well.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    ...HiMERU-han, you're so calm. You probably don't even feel the slightest bit scared after hearing all those horror stories, do you?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Well, that's right. With being in the industry, those kinds of stories can be heard floating around extremely often, but they aren't very credible.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Eh?! That much?!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Yes. They're on TV and the radio. It appears that there's more horror stories about studios and such, and there are also myths about occupied hotels on the countryside.
    
    In addition, like Shiina described, the ES building has many mysteries of its own.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Uuu…just what're you trying to say...?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    However. As explained previously, the stories aren't credible, so you don't really need to be scared of them.
    
    More importantly, these horror stories have inconsistencies that HiMERU is more interested in.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    I really don't know how else to say this, but you're a really dry fellow. Finding flaws in horror stories really is something only *you* would have the audacity to do, HiMERU-han.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![fair nuff](https://64.media.tumblr.com/1df3767ca124f693ae7e0120ff9633a4/19d33e9ecfaf3ae2-e2/s2048x3072/9838446ded56b87c20e624bd27e83549358610b7.pnj)

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Well, that's fair enough.
    
    —Oukawa. We've arrived at the restroom. HiMERU will wait for you outside, so please go and do what you have to.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Ah. Yeah, I'll get going then.
    
    Umm, the lightswitch—ah, there it is. I'll just flip it and…
    
    There.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    <th>*(Even though the lights turned on and it's bright...I don't know why the bathroom's making me so anxious. There’s a big mirror plus it’s still and quiet space, I wonder if that's what's making me feel that way.)*</th>
    
    <th>*(There's no chance I'm gonna feel any better by staying here. Alright. HiMERU-han is still waiting for me out there. There's probably nothing weird in such a clean restroom either.)*</th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Don't be scared, don't be scared, don't be scared...
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    I'm Rinne-kuuun<sup>**(3)**</sup>. And I'm behind Kohaku-chyan right nyoooow…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    GyaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAH!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    O-Oukawa?! What's going on?!
    
    .........
    
    Um. Just what kind of situation is this exactly?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    GyaaAAH! My arm! It's gonna break, it'll break!!!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    I, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I'm not afraid if you come at me! Get the *hell* outta here, you ghost!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    …What happened is clearer now. This idiot snuck past HiMERU's blind spot and startled Oukawa, correct?
    
    Oukawa, Oukawa. Please calm down and look. That's not a ghost, but it's Amagi.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    GyaaaAA—ah...?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Kohaku-chan! Give, give<sup>**(4)**</sup>! At this rate you'll break my arm! You'll break it clean off!
  {% endbubble %}

  ![unbl](https://64.media.tumblr.com/f03962534f16a85d6fda3aaa67907ccf/19d33e9ecfaf3ae2-5b/s2048x3072/126b5733720a0891a0f5d9c304506d770773ec4d.pnj)

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    ..... Hrrmph!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Owowowowow! Kohaku-chan! I'm telling you it's not a ghost, it's me, it's *me!* I'm your "unit"s reliable leader Amagi Rinne, I'm telling you!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    *Obviously* I'm tightening my grip because of you! You're always going around doing all sorts of nonsense!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Auuughhhh! Give, give, *give!*
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Haah...you two need to stop it. If you keep being this loud then the security guards will get suspicious. Our plans will be impeded if that ends up happening.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    You're such an *asshole!* I've had enough of all this!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Agreed. That was done in bad taste, Amagi.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![okaeeeee](https://64.media.tumblr.com/bad7e09a90e6f39d71a473d784c056f4/19d33e9ecfaf3ae2-2f/s2048x3072/3384c146e9e961f4af5d9246d48466ff0431fb8b.pnj)

  {% bubble Niki %}
    n? Mrhff mrrrpgh~ (Welcome baaack~) Mogumogu<sup>**(5)**</sup>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Aah! Niki! Just what are you doing, eating all by yourself?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    —Mogumogu… gulp. It's because Kohaku-chan, HiMERU-kun, and Rinne-kun all left and never came back~
    
    Seriously! I was out here having a bad time too, yknow? Usually to save energy I'd be sleeping by now. But since I'm up late I got hungry. I got *really* hungry…
    
    Plus, I used up calories telling those 100 stories, so my hunger level really reached its limit. Mogumogu…
  {% endbubble %}

  ![i didnt know](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a2c6380008052d157ad47ac68e4c0c75/19d33e9ecfaf3ae2-3e/s2048x3072/155f3f79d4839f6531063b941f655777503238a8.pnj)

  {% bubble Niki %}
    I really *was* gonna wait until everyone got back, y'know that? But I didn't know how long that was gonna take. I was stuck on what I should do until I heard Kohaku's scream from somewhere far off<sup>**(6)**</sup>.
    
    I figured Rinne-kun played some kind of prank on Kohaku-chan in order to scare him, so I guessed you'd be late coming back. I wasn't just gonna wait to starve to death, so I ate and replenished my energy. Mogumogu…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Impressive, Shiina. It's almost like you were there to witness it. It was unexpected that you'd guess 100% of Amagi's actions.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Mogumogu…Well, we have been together for a long time~ I can just tell when most things are gonna happen. Mogumogu.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Don't just sit and eat while you explain. Share some with us too.
    
    —Ah?! You already ate most of it?!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Ah. That pizza with all your favorite toppings on it, I saved it for last. Rinne-kun, please don't try to eat that alone!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Look who's talking. Bastard.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    I really wonder if this counts as training…
  {% endbubble %}

  <!-- Translation Notes (Chapter 8) -->

  <h4>Translation Notes</h4>

  (3): He used “atashi” here instead of “orecchi” (normally) or “ore” (speaking seriously)

  (4): That's how it's written in the textbox in ktkn but in case the clarification is needed he's like saying “Uncle!”/“Give up”/“Get off” etc. Basically asking Kohaku to surrender.

  (5): Like last time, the muffled noises are what's in the parenthesis, as you can see.

  (6): Callback to the end of the prologue!!
