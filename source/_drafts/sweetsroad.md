{% bubble Niki %}
Alright~, thank you for waiting! Here's Suou-kun's croque-monsieúr and Kohaku-chan's curry.

You two must be close if you're having lunch together! Are you two hanging out?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
That's not it. It's just a shopping trip.

Today we have activities for both our circles "Sweets Club" and "Kaori", so we gotta buy sweets to take for "Sweets Club".
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Hmm. The two of you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Well yeah. We share the same circles.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
I guess you both are close friends after all! Ow...!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
It's a _coincidence_, got it, Niki-han?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Got it! I get it now, so don't pinch my cheeks~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
Fufu, Oukawa being shy is barbaric.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Hah? Being shy?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
I was a member of both "Circles" first, before you. That means you definitely joined when you found out I was in them.

Which _means_, you wanted to join both clubs because _I_ was there. Right, Koha-kun~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
That's ridiculous. Like I _said_, it was just a coincidence. Don't be so self-centered.

By the way, Niki-han. I've got a question for you, do you know about any good sweets shops?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
We're facing some difficulty since we've gone to all the stores we know of as well as all of the well known ones. Any advice you have is appreciated.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
So you'd be looking for a place that's a hidden gem, right?

Hmm...Why don't I make it? The "Sweets Club" has never ordered from me before, so I think I fit the bill~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
Ah, that's true. Could you do that for us?
{% endbubble %}

![Niki Unbloomed CG](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8379668c0c7370690e3bf29d5f230020/5e121996eb7f828b-c2/s2048x3072/0a61cb6d1112e65bab1e854d274b90ea52877c58.png)

{% bubble Niki %}
Roger~ Please wait for me while you eat. My part-time shift is almost finished. So I'll use the kitchen to make something.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>30 minutes later.</p>
  </div>

{% bubble Niki %}
Sorry to keep you waiting~ Here are my homemade snowball cookies!<sup>**(1)**</sup>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Ohoho. Don't they look cute and round?

There's three different colors, does that mean there's three different tastes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Exactly. Brown is cocoa flavored, pink is strawberry flavored, and purple is yam flavored. I made a bunch, so please give them a try~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
Thank you. Now then, I'll take your word for it...

_"Marvelous~"_ It's delicious. It has a gentle flavor and could go well with any kind of tea.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
It's got a nice, crunchy texture too. I'm positive this is a good choice for "Sweets Club". Thanks, Niki-han.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>An hour later.</p>
  </div>

{% bubble HiMERU %}
So, why is Shiina here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
He is our special "Guest" today. He's the one that made the "Snowball Cookies" we took with us.

Even though he's not a member, he is still a comrade that loves "Sweets". So, there wouldn't be a reason for us not to invite him right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
That's right! I love eating and making sweets~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Understood. HiMERU can accept that. What about you, Ayase?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
I, I can accept that too, but um...

I made homemade butter sable. But when compared to Shiina-san's, who's a professional chef...

Aah, I want to die. It's so embarrassing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Mogumogu...mm!<sup>**(2)**</sup> Mayo-chan's butter sable is actually really good!

You can't die when you make such good food, so live for my sake!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
You're being too persistent, Shiina. This isn't a speed-eating competition, calm down.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Nyahaha. I'm sorry, I just finished my part-time shift so I'm hungry...
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
Nono, please don't fret. Seeing Shiina-san eat so well is refreshing. Seeing him going on a mindless binge is scary, though...♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
HiMERU-han, what did you bring? You must've brought something fancy and unusual like always.
{% endbubble %}

![HiMERU is square cream puffs](https://64.media.tumblr.com/49bf2527017a411bb0d241dea275fcd6/5e121996eb7f828b-0a/s2048x3072/bc3dbc06a2c36452b8e5a0548f21d7f55214ae6e.png)

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Ufufu. Now then, HiMERU will present it.

HiMERU is square cream puffs<sup>**(3)**</sup>.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Eh, HiMERU-kun is actually a square cream puff?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
What a silly reaction...HiMERU is HiMERU, you already know that don't you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Nyaha! It's a jooooke~! A "Crazy:B" joke!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Quit it. If you say "Crazy:B", then that would include me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
Um, may I try some of your cream puffs, HiMERU-senpai?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Yes. Please help yourself and try them.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
Thank you.
...? It look's like a cake, doesn't it? Ah, I get it now, the cream is filled tight inside.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
The square shape makes it easy to hold, so I can just pop it in my mouth~

Oh god! I was just gonna have a taste before I ate it, but I ended up just gobbling it all! I think I'm mostly the one eating all the snowball cookies I brought in too. Mogumogu...
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
So you acknowledge it, but you haven't slowed one bit.

At this rate it'll just be a buffet for Shiina, so please go make something else in the kitchen to make up for it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Okaaay! Any requests?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
Well then...could you try making something with this matcha?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
Tsukasa-san, do you always carry around matcha with you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
No, just for today. I was able to get good matcha due to "Kaori"s activities.
{% endbubble %}

![I can't decide...](https://64.media.tumblr.com/32a6ceb2221b4f5e58adecfc72050eb9/5e121996eb7f828b-f0/s2048x3072/b28145a66a3743252601cc8bdc61c2a248505fec.png)

{% bubble Niki %}
I can't decide what to make with this~ Pancakes, ice cream, doughnuts, scones, or even matcha flavored cakes all sound so good! Ah, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it...

Okay! I'm gonna make a whole bunch of things, so please wait for me~!

<!-- Translation notes -->

<h4>Translation Notes</h4>

(1): Snowball cookies are a kind of cookie that's usually coated with powdered sugar. I've had them before! They're crunchy and kinda crumbly and with the powdered sugar it really does remind me of a snowball falling apart. They're really easy to make too so I definitely recommend looking up a recipe !!

(2): I don't know how to write sound effects but Niki here tried one of Mayoi's sweets. “Mogumogu” is the japanese onomatopoeia for chewing sounds, so you get the point.

(3): I think some wordplay is coming into the story here, kind of like a pun. HiMERU usually says “HiMERU is HiMERU” to Crazy:B members. So, the phrase "HiMERU is square cream puffs" is a play on that phrase, which Niki reacts in a really funny way to.
