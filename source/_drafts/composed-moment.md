{% bubble Kohaku %}
Whew…I gave it my best today. Good work, HiMERU-han.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
–Yes. Good work to you as well, Oukawa. Now then, shall we begin our return?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Huh? Where’d Niki-han go? I know Rinne-han said he was gonna go off to play mahjong somewhere, but…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Shiina was forced to keep Amagi company. He’d looked to HiMERU as if he was silently crying for help, but of course HiMERU paid it no mind.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Ohhh, so that’s how it is. You made your escape after sacrificing Niki-han, HiMERU-han.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
“Sacrifice” is a strong word. HiMERU simply saw that it was getting late and decided it was about time to leave.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Good that you did. We’re underage, so it wouldn’t be too good for us to be walking around so late anyway.

Now that I'm actually thinking about going to school, I probably won’t have to stick with Rinne-han on his nights off anymore.

Well, it’s too late in the day to want to think that far ahead, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Right, but it’s always good to plan and be aware.

As far as you know, Oukawa, anyone with poor intentions could take a casual moment and transform it into a scandal.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Yeah. Well, we wouldn’t be the type to get caught in those kinds of predicaments.

Was that actually why you tried to get away from Rinne-han, HiMERU-han?

I heard somewhere that you were planning to go back to school at one point, HiMERU-han. If you get caught out at night and get suspended that wouldn’t be too good.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
–No. Like HiMERU said, he simply wanted to leave quickly.

Different from your case, Oukawa, HiMERU wasn’t doing anything intentionally because of his schooling plans.
{% endbubble %}

![FUCKING SIGHS](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1710033253/enstars/dialogue/himeru%20fs2/ch1/ijoygk7gzrkqpdtpzdj1.png)

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Whether he returns to school or not, HiMERU will continue to live as HiMERU.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
That so. Well, I’m sure you feel like it's a little late for you to go to highschool now anyways, HiMERU-han.

But…HiMERU-han? As a student attending <i>school?</i> I can’t wrap my head around that at all.

…Hmm? It’s Anzu-han. Good evening. Looks like you're on your way home too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
–At this hour it’s unsafe for a woman to be alone. Would you like an accompaniment?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
You say you still have work to do? You’re still gonna work even though it’s this late?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
It would be beneficial for you to take breaks and work at a slower pace.

You’re almost finished, so it’ll be alright? That doesn’t sound like you’d be following HiMERU’s advice.
{% endbubble %}

![workaholic](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1710033253/enstars/dialogue/himeru%20fs2/ch1/iiohzegbhsbuse00tsi4.png)

{% bubble Kohaku %}
So this is what a workaholic is like, huh. Rinne-han could learn a thing or two from that. 

HiMERU-han and I were just talking about school, since back-to-school time is coming up.

You almost forgot HiMERU-han went to school?

Koh koh koh~ So you think so too?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
–It’s not surprising that Anzu-san would think that, since HiMERU has been away from school for a while.

He has rarely had the chance to visit the academy since he began working more with her.
{% endbubble %}

![hm](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1710033253/enstars/dialogue/himeru%20fs2/ch1/cxpqvglylxl3pjzmerhf.png)

{% bubble Kohaku %}
What’s wrong, Anzu-han? What’re you suddenly mumbling for…?

H-huh? “It might be good to make a brochure of his student life”...? Just what are you on about?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
It sounds like she’s come up with an idea. Were you trying to plan something?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
<th>*(But, it’s oddly difficult to discern what she’s planning from what she’s muttering.)*</th>

<th>*(It sounds like…“Both long and short term fans of Crazy:B would be happy with it”--)*</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Anzu-san, could it be that you’re referring to HiMERU’s “Feature Live”?

HiMERU knew it, he supposed he would be hearing from you about it soon.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Ohh, so that’s what you were getting at. You were talking about the pamphlet that goes along with the “Feature Live”?

With the way you were mumbling all of a sudden, Anzu-han, I was starting to think you were possessed…
{% endbubble %}

![hhhhnmieds](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1710033251/enstars/dialogue/himeru%20fs2/ch1/ibnxblkexiyo9oxc7mrh.png)

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Fufu. Well, whatever the case may have been, HiMERU thinks it would be a great idea to use off-shots<sup>(1)</sup> of his school life.

There may not be many more opportunities to promote HiMERU in that light in the future given his activities with Crazy:B.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Rinne-han and Niki-han aren’t students, so there’s <i>no</i> chance for them to be doing work at school unless it's something special.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
–However, HiMERU has only decided to return to school. The formal paperwork has yet to be completed.

So, if you would like to host a photoshoot at Shuutetsu Academy, you may have to wait a while.

Yes. HiMERU will contact you when everything is ready, Anzu-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Hehe. You look really excited, Anzu-han. I’m excited to see what pamphlet you two come up with~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
HiMERU isn’t quite sure what exactly it is you’re imagining, but it’ll prove to be difficult if you expect too much.

HiMERU will always be HiMERU. Regardless of if he’s a student or not, that’s a fact that will never change.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
Oya? Why hello there, HiMERU-shi. It seems like I’ve been crossing paths with you a lot today.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Oh, Vice President. Thank you for your help in the academy earlier.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
Oh, no need to thank me. I simply assisted after seeing there were a few procedures that were troubling you.

Are you having lunch now? It seems like you’re having a can of coffee<sup>(2)</sup> and a few snacks, will that be enough?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
You’ve bought the same, haven’t you? It doesn’t look like what you bought is much different from what HiMERU did.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
On the contrary, I bought healthy foods. At least that’s a bit better than a few sweets.

I understand not wanting to spend too much precious time eating, however–
{% endbubble %}

![worry](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1710103361/enstars/dialogue/himeru%20fs2/ch2/w24htiiozjtxqtmkw3wi.png)

{% bubble HiMERU %}
HiMERU plans to have a proper meal after he’s completed work. He’s only having something small yet because he hasn’t finished yet, so there’s no need to worry.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
I see, so that’s how it is. In that case, sorry for the unnecessary worry!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
–It’s surprising how many times you’ve encountered HiMERU today, Vice President.

Was there something important you needed to tell him?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
Nooo, not something important. We’re just having a casual chat right now, so there’s no need to be so cynical.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
HiMERU didn’t think that you would be doing something that’s not to your benefit, Vice President. Forgive him if that’s offensive.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
No offense taken. I don’t think that your perception of me is completely incorrect, HiMERU-shi.

Let’s just say I was paying attention to you since you were in a school uniform, a rare thing to see.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Understood. HiMERU will think of it that way.
{% endbubble %}

![anzuuu](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1710103356/enstars/dialogue/himeru%20fs2/ch2/yw9soknbpjnycczduiza.png)

{% bubble HiMERU %}
–Oya, excuse me. You seem to have dropped your bag…hm? It looks like Anzu-san is here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
Why hello there, Anzu-san! Lucky seeing you here today! Though it is a shame that you’re seeing me like this…

What’s the matter, Anzu-san? You look so surprised that you seem to have also dropped your jaw…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
“Are we shooting something?” No. We’re just taking a break…

HiMERU can’t see anything that would make you think it would be a photo shoot…wait, could it be because we’re in school uniforms?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
That seems to be the case. I see. I suppose it would be surprising for you to see HiMERU-shi in uniform for the first time…

Come again? You’re surprised to see me in uniform as well? But haven’t you already seen me like this before?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Is it because you’ve only ever seen him doing business and production work nowadays? So that’s how it is. HiMERU can agree with that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
Well if you’re going to say that, then Anzu-san would be the same. I, for one, am more used to seeing her in a suit myself.
{% endbubble %}

![uniform](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1710103359/enstars/dialogue/himeru%20fs2/ch2/le5gdkdjitfgxofiyyue.png)

{% bubble HiMERU %}
–You’re asking why we’re in uniform? HiMERU was simply moving from Shuutetsu Academy to ES as he normally does.

 …What’s wrong? You look displeased, HiMERU isn’t sure how to react…

“You said you’d contact me once you returned to the academy” you say…?

–Yes. HiMERU <i>did</i> say that he’d contact you for a photo shoot for his “Feature Live”. 

However, HiMERU was simply there to finish the procedures needed for his return to school.

HiMERU hasn’t forgotten about that, he just had more work to tend to afterwards.

–Oh, there’s no need to apologize. You understand now, and that’s all that matters.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
If you’d told me about that, then I would have been able to prepare a set for you. Well, it <i>was</i> just a verbal agreement.

If you intend to host a photo shoot at the school, just let me know. I’ll help with communication.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Thank you. However, since you’re here Anzu-san, then shall we prepare the photo shoot here?

Oya? That sound…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
<th>*(Was that Anzu-san’s stomach? She <b>is</b> quite the busy person, so she may not have had the chance to eat yet.)*</th>

<th>*(It would be rude to point it out in an attempt to confirm it, especially since she’s covering her face in embarrassment.)*</th>

<th>*(That shouldn’t constitute ignoring it though. There’s no other choice…)*</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
–Anzu-san, if you’d like, take this.

Please help yourself. Each pack has more than one piece of candy, so there is still more left over.

You've been very busy recently, so there would be no harm in keeping your sugar levels stable.

Perhaps you had a different flavor preference? HiMERU does have more flavors on hand…

Don’t be shy, take as you’d like. Please tell HiMERU if you want more.

He wouldn’t be able to eat all of this himself, so you’d be helping him as well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Would you also like some, Vice President? There’s no need to hesitate.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
Like I said before, I already have my share…but since you’re offering so kindly I’ll take one.

It’ll go over my sugar intake for today, but it’s nothing exercise can’t fix.

…Hmph. It’s really sweet.
{% endbubble %}

![bitter](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1710103362/enstars/dialogue/himeru%20fs2/ch2/mj1jozoe46otycsyccgx.png)

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Would you prefer one with a bitter flavor?

…Hm? What’s wrong, Anzu-san?

“It’s really refreshing to see you two having a conversation in uniform like students”, you say…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
What about the conversation was “student-like”? Was it the fact that we were talking about sharing snacks and eating them?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Well, HiMERU isn’t quite sure. If he’s sure about one thing, it’s that it feels strange to be spending time like this casually together.

–Anzu-san. When did you get your camera…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
“I can never miss a picture perfect chance”, you say. That’s just like you, Anzu-san!

I have full faith in your “off-shoot senses”! Now, go right ahead! Take a picture that will perfectly help HiMERU-shi’s “Feature Live”!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Good grief. HiMERU still has work after this, so he didn’t want to start the photo shoot so suddenly.

Well, it’s fine. HiMERU will always be perfect no matter the time or place~
{% endbubble %}
