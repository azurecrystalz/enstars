  ![net is](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8944368e0b981b7fa77d98b9b30e5138/5b9ab7949c23ea34-5b/s2048x3072/572d21ae1023a7dc33b1c346f10b7b59f8ebda2f.pnj)

  {% bubble Hinata %}
    Uuuun. It's never gonna stop… could it be that the net is too heavy?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Hiiro %}
    Heavy? Net? I never knew weight could be added to the net! Aira told me that the net is "invisible like air, but that air is almost everywhere now".
    
    If one person finds it too heavy, then why not two? I'll give you a hand, Hinata-kun, so that we can split the load.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Hinata %}
    Wah! I've been *totally* misunderstood!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Hiiro %}
    Nn? Is it not like that?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Hinata %}
    Basically, it's not about whether or not I need a hand. Right now, I've downloaded a new game onto this game console…
    
    Hiiro-kun, do you know how to download things?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Hiiro %}
    That I was taught! It's when you take information and store it in a terminal, isn't it?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Hinata %}
    Right, right. When there's a slow storage speed we call that "heavy" … so it's not like someone helping is going to make it faster.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Hiiro %}
    Uuun. Hinata-kun, if you can't fix it, then I can't find the right answer.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Hinata %}
    Well, all we gotta do in the end is just be patient and let it be until we can play the game!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Hiiro %}
    That makes sense to me now. Fufu, Hinata-kun, you always explain things so clearly.
    
    But, what made it so heavy? If we can improve it, then it would be better if we did.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Hinata %}
    I think I can guess the reason~ It might be because there's a sequel to a popular game that was released today, so a lot of people might be downloading it at the same time~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Hiiro %}
    Heeeh, I suppose that kind of glitch can happen when a lot of people do it at once.
    
    This game…? It has an extremely colorful screen. My eyes are starting to sting.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Hinata %}
    It's a lot easier to see when you get used to it. It's a turf game where you take your position and paint<sup>**(1)**</sup>. Once it's done downloading, do you want to play, Hiiro-kun?
  {% endbubble %}

  ![me?](https://64.media.tumblr.com/afecbc0854e86149e92e2d3bcaf0ae38/5b9ab7949c23ea34-a1/s2048x3072/1b462702c7f59fa7eadd7d9b430eddfcbae1e897.pnj)

  {% bubble Hiiro %}
    Me? Are you sure? Last time we played together, I shoved into you, Hinata-kun, and I might do the same this time.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Hinata %}
    Ahaha. Hiiro-kun, your whole body moves when you play video games.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Hiiro %}
    Umu. I do it out of reflex. It's hard to play the game and sit still.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Hinata %}
    It's alright, it's alright★~ Don't worry about your body moving. These games are more fun to play with friends, anyways.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Hiiro %}
    I see. If it really is that much fun, then I want to try it.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Hinata %}
    Hm? By the way, has Shiina-senpai come back yet? I wanted him to join our group.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Hiiro %}
    I got a message saying *"I'm going to be staying with everyone at ES building today, so I won't be coming back to the dorm"*. So maybe you received that message too, Hinata-kun?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Hinata %}
    Eh, is that so. I was too busy downloading the game, so I didn't notice.
    I see~, so Shiina-senpai really can't come join us then? What a bummer!
  {% endbubble %}

  ![thats good](https://64.media.tumblr.com/507dbd8c1829414c8c3af862d067b8f8/5b9ab7949c23ea34-ae/s2048x3072/def4508aced4fb933e471bca58585751b6c04099.pnj)

  {% bubble Hinata %}
    That's good though~ A sleepover at ES sounds like *so* much fun…
  {% endbubble %}

  ![haa](https://64.media.tumblr.com/f2526c400eee87adb56beb10e300fc71/5b9ab7949c23ea34-7b/s2048x3072/bb4c9158fc5a7ee66be65cdb270c42012d107a3f.pnj)

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Haaa…
    
    Oiii, everyoneee? If you can hear me, could you please answer?

    ..........

    Haa… I can't hear anything, so I guess that really means there's no one here…
    
    Kohaku-chan and HiMERU-kun are gone… and then Rinne-kun disappeared too…so that leaves me all by myself in this room…
    
    Just how did it come down to this~? I knew I shouldn't have done those 100-stories at all. I wasn't too thrilled about it to begin with, and this isn't something for the faint-hearted.
    
    Ahh, at this rate… I'm going to…I'm…

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    GyaaaAAAHHH!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    ! Th-That scream just now…wasn't it Kohaku-chan?!
    
    No...! There's no way…was Kohaku-chan finally sacrificed?!
