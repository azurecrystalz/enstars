    Fufu. In our case, those who live by their idols—die by their idols.
    
    On the contrary, that is no life someone should live. Your precious life will rot away, and you will eventually perish.
    
    I worry about you, HiMERU-san.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —Shut up.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    ......!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Cut the crap...Don't start spewing these useless sermons onto "me" now, you pious asshole.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    .....
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Shall I shut that bullshit-filled mouth of yours up—"Tatsumi-senpai"?
  {% endbubble %}

    ...

    ...Fufu~

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Aha, haha. Ahahahaha...~!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —No, you aren’t supposed to laugh there.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    A-apologies. I really am not used to any of this.
    
    Ah, you wouldn't say all of these things HiMERU-san, or do any of that, or release any of that murderous intent...~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    .......
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    In addition to that, it made me happy to hear you call me "Tatsumi-senpai" the way you used to in the past.

    I wasn't sure how to cope with all of those different emotions, so in the end I reacted strangely...That wasn't your fault at all, HiMERU-san.

    I'm sorry to have delayed you for this long.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —It's nothing you need to apologize for, since it is also HiMERU's fault this isn't going smoothly.

    As a matter of fact, HiMERU isn't used to this either.
    
    Ever since ES's establishment— or rather, ever since HiMERU joined "Crazy:B"—he feels like he's been made to take on jobs he's never tried previously<sup>**(1)**</sup>.

    But this..."work"...is meddlesome.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Is that so? HiMERU-san, you've always been spoken highly of for your solo work in films and dramas but…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —Those kinds of things have *scripts.* At least with those there's a "correct" answer to an extent, and you'll have some idea of the habits of big actors if you study their previous performances in them thoroughly.

    But this job has none of that. A scenario was prepared, but it's up to us, as the actors, to decide what exactly we'd like to say and do.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    In all honesty, this field of work is not particularly interesting, so there is no way to even get started in learning about it.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Aah, I'm the same way. We really are alike, HiMERU-san~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    ......
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    My whole life, I never really had much contact with "games". The concept of romantic love is also unfamiliar to me.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    That wouldn't be the same thing as "God's Love" (Agape)<sup>**(2)**</sup>, would it?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Those things are completely different. Games that endlessly preach the idea of "God's Love" (Agape) are loathsome.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Agreed...ah, I'm a bit troubled. Our current job is to "act as characters in a dating simulator".
  {% endbubble %}

<h4>Translation Notes</h4>

  (1): For people unfamiliar with Crazy:B’s need to get work: getting jobs is important to them as it helps them survive as a unit. Because of the incidents during MDM (mainstory), they had a negative image. Finding jobs is hard for them but it’s the only way for them to get a better reputation in order for them to continue being idols (which of course is extremely valuable to each of them in their own way).

  (2): Yes “God’s Love” (Agape) is written exactly like this in the dialogue box even in HiMERU’s dialogue. According to Google, Agape is the term that defines God’s immeasurable, incomparable love for humankind. The more you know (I am not religious in the slightest).

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —Now then. Shall we go over the work's premise from the beginning? At this rate, we'll never get anything done.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Yes.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    "There Are So Many Idols In Love With Me I Just Don't Know What To Do - Love Battle Stadium", also known as "Ai-Stars", is a dating simulator game made for women.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Yes.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    By the way, there are a lot of game projects that real idols star in, and there are some that only have their faces modeled.

    For example, there's "Ansta" a fighting game in which special abilities are used based on a battle manga<sup>**(3)**</sup>.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    "Ansta"...fumu, I'm not too familiar with that.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Apparently it's popular enough that it will be made into its own anime. HiMERU isn't informed much on the details himself, but groups would get into trouble in the past for creating characters inspired by real life idols without their consent.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Is that so…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Well, all those characters were based on Yumenosaki idols, so it wasn't really much of an issue for Reimei or HiMERU. And so, of all the plenty idol-inspired games, "Ai-Star" seems to be the most popular now.

    Originally it was a "mobile game" available on smartphones apparently. Then, with the use of "SSVRS" technology it was adapted into an all-new hit VR game. It's like falling in love with a real idol, they say. Even more so because of the fact that ES closely collaborated with the project.

    Each idols’ looks, verbiage, and actions were replicated, so it's popularity is no surprise. Thanks to "Ai-stars", "SSVRS" VR headset sales have gone up, and now a large amount of people are playing the game for themselves at home.

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Fufu. You sure are informed, HiMERU-san. You had to have done a lot of studying beforehand.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    But of course. HiMERU would never risk sullying the reputation HiMERU's name has. So he will do his best and ensure there is not a single part of the job left unfinished.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Wonderful. I, too, don't plan to leave anything unfinished. However, this makes me realize that I still might not be giving it my complete best.
    
    HiMERU-san, I'll learn from your example and keep working even harder.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —"Ai-star"'s premise is to make it so that female producers are able to fall in love with a lot of male idols.
    
    In addition, if you tried hard enough, you could be in a romantic relationship with your favorite idols and even marry them.
    
    Actually, that just seems to be the whole point of the game.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Is that even okay? Wouldn't there be legal and ethical issues?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    It's just fiction.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Fumu...I'll agree to disagree. However, I have another question still. This is a game where...a female producer falls in love with a male idol, isn't it?
    
    I don't know much on that myself but...
    
    If it's supposed to be a work where the relationship is between a man and a woman, then why were we—as men—whispering flirtatious words to each other?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Was that your idea of flirting? You suddenly started quoting the Bible.
    
    It was surprising and it messed up the entire conversation.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Fufu. Apologies. I'm really clueless...
    
    *"The assassin is on the run after defecting from the organization, and the assassin that is hot on his tail! The pursued and the pursuer! What type of forbidden love will sprout between them both?!"*

    ...That was the scenario assigned to us, but I don't get half of it.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    HiMERU can't blame you, Tatsumi. Doesn't that kind of story seem heavy? It looks like you can experience all kinds of scenarios like that in "Ai-star".
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Wasn't this a game about falling in love with idols...? Why are there assassins in it?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Don't ask HiMERU. Projects like these have always had a tendency to overextend over a period of time. They need to constantly add updates—each of them being more diverse than the one before.

    "Ai-stars" has been around for a long time, and with the amount of things being added to it, it's starting to become confusing.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    It seems like even the producers of it feel the same. I can definitely sympathize with how they feel.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    As an aside, "Ai-stars" is a live-action production and you might not know what that is, Tatsumi. Essentially, it's a game made with the idol's actual voice and appearance, so that's why we're being made to film the materials that are necessary to the games production.

    HiMERU doesn't really get why we have to act our romantic scenarios with each other as men. They said it would be more efficient that way...but he wonders if that's actually the reason.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Fumu, I wouldn't know how it would be efficient, but for us we've gone the opposite direction. We've become inefficient.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    ...Yes. Unfortunately.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Nothing.
    
    If it were like that, then each "unit" would be photographed on their own—but the higher-ups at "Ai-stars" distributed a bigger request of working in romantic pairs.

  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —And lastly, the issue at hand, "HiMERU and Kazehaya Tatsumi".
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Fumu. I wonder if they paired us up because we're both from Reimei.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Their intentions are vague. Judging by the behaviors of the higher-ups, evil desires are to be suspected.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Desires?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    It appears as though a part of the audience gets really happy when seeing their favorite men getting along well with each other.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    I, too, get happy when I see people I love getting along well.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    That wasn't what HiMERU was getting at.

    Anyway, all of the others besides us have finished quickly and with no issue. It's unfortunate for HiMERU that we seem to be the only ones unfit for this kind of work.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Yes. It seems that even though I like to act like as a proper senior, this isn't something I can do easily.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    That's not really your fault, Tatsumi. Or actually, it's your fault that you keep behaving erratically, but there's a slightly bigger issue at hand—and that is the filming won't stop unless we produce something that will satisfy the requirements of the higher-ups, or something.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    No matter how bad the acting is, if the producers like it, then it's OK, and if they don't, then it gets an NG<sup>**(5)**</sup>.
    
    An example, our Shiina and your Ayase were terrible. A starving Shiina chased a sobbing Ayase around, and a scenario like *that* earned "That's exactly the shot I was looking for!" and they got an OK from the first take.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Fufu. Aira-san and his friend<sup>**(6)**</sup> just idly sat and had a friendly chat about sweets, and that immediately earned them the OK. So, why aren't *we* getting it?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Maybe we should predict what the producer is looking for and change our approach accordingly, but we have no way of knowing what makes a take get an OK or an NG.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![warning](https://64.media.tumblr.com/2eb3c880e352663dddc391beed2d6119/56194fd0f5487762-2e/s1280x1920/85aa444ab1ed2c5db9d672fedf2ace4c8799adb7.jpg)

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    It's certainly confusing. When it came to the Amagi brothers, our Amagi tried to act like he was seducing your Amagi at first—they didn't get the OK to that, since apparently it wasn't what the producer would have liked.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Yes, they were also struggling. Since the other two pairs were able to leave early, all that was left was us and them for a while.

    I tried to motivate Hiiro-san by saying something like "Let's see who can leave here first".
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Their relationship is close. But, while they were chatting on a break, the younger of the two, who was getting really tired from work he was unfamiliar with, moved closer to the older and turned to look at him...and called out "Ni-saaan~".

    The second he looked like he wanted to be spoiled, they immediately received the OK. It seems like that kind of thing was what the producers were looking for.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Fufu. The older brother got surprised and then all flustered. I wonder if that kind of odd scenario is what the producers want.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![clear](https://64.media.tumblr.com/defbe5ede9d41ded5be56785ff32e4d1/56194fd0f5487762-23/s1280x1920/209ef96d5566dc463385dd662de2ec2c9a0e27df.jpg)

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    I wish they'd just say something if that was the case. I still don't know what the producer wants.
    
    I guess that everything kind of *is* supposed to be spontaneous and surprising, but I still haven't been able to get used to your aggressive tone from before, HiMERU-san.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    .........
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    We really still can't seem to get the OK. I wonder what's wrong? Perhaps, should I try to talk more like <ho>Koga-san<sup>**(7)**</sup>?</ho>

    Fumu. I really wish there was a way to simply ask the producer what it is they'd like.

    For whatever strange reason, every time we tried to get close to them, they'd run away while shouting "If I look at handsome men for too long my eyes will melt!"
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Just what was that even about...just why is such an eccentric person even in a position of power? It just shows how good at game production they must be.

    It's unfortunate, but we'll just need to keep shooting our shots in the dark—if this keeps up, then we'll never get this done.

<h4>Translation Notes</h4>

(4): Referring to the fact that “Niki” and “Mayoi” are both written in katakana.

(5): “NG” is an abbreviation for “no good” used typically in casual business talk.

(6): Idk why Tatsumi didn’t just refer to Kohaku here but the line literally says “Aira-san and the other” but it felt too stiff so I used friend to lessen confusion

(7): For those unaware, Koga and Tatsumi are roommates!

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi%}
  Just what do you keep talking about?!

  If you have any issues, you know you can always come talk to me HiMERU-san. It'll just be between you and me as friends, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
  We are strangers and definitely not close friends, got it?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi%}
  No. Um, I never called myself a close friend.

{% bubble HiMERU %}
  <th><i>(Ugh. It’s no use. It's one thing if everything Tatsumi does is angering, but nothing will be solved with taking it all out on him.)</i></th>

  <th><i>(If the doctor's diagnosis is anything to go by, it would be better to ask others for help. Even if it's difficult.)</i></th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
  So, Tatsumi…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi%}
  Yes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
  There's no simple way to explain this, but HiMERU has started seeing his reality as some sort of game.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi%}
  Huh...?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
  According to the doctor's tests, it's an unforeseen side effect of playing "SSVRS", especially with being immersed in a VR world for a prolonged period of time.

  HiMERU appears to be unable to distinguish reality from games.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi%}
  Aah, I've heard of something like that vaguely before.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
  Right. "SSVRS" is made to trick the brain and one's senses into believing fiction is reality. So it makes sense that playing it for an extended period of time may be detrimental to the game.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi%}
  W-wouldn't that make it a harmful device?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
  ...It's probably fine. If it wasn't, then they wouldn't be sold on the market.

  HiMERU is, to clarify, vulnerable to outside influences. According to the doctor, this is a symptom that appeared unexpectedly because of that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi%}
  ? What does that mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
  Explaining in detail is unnecessary. At any rate, HiMERU is having physical and mental repercussions because of "SSVRS" and that's all you need to know.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi%}
  Right.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
  Another thing. The doctor said that until HiMERU finally beats the game, the symptoms won't disappear.

  Completing the game is crucial, as the brain needs to be tricked. When that happens, HiMERU would be freed from the game world like waking up from a dream.

  That’s just a theory though. This is a completely unexpected situation, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi%}
  Fumu....however, I checked "Ai-stars" and its details, but this is supposedly a mobile game, correct? I've heard that there's no way to "clear" those games.

  It’s not like Super M-rio, where all you have to do is defeat B-wser and save Princess P-ach, right?<sup>**(9)**</sup>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
  It's odd to hear those kinds of words from you, Tatsumi. But yes, mobile games have no "end" so long as their servers are still in service.

  Fortunately, in "Ai-stars" case--there is something called a "true ending". The game ends when a certain character's route is completed.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi%}
  Route...?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Uhuh... 

So basically, you wanted us to help HiMERU-han and the others, is that right Anzu-han? 

Hmmm. Yesterday we were able to get the job done without a hitch, but HiMERU-han is having an unusually hard time with it–
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Hey, can't you at least respond with something? It’s lonely talking by myself, y'know.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
Ah, eh? Right! I'm sorryyy!

Anzu-san never said anything to me! She's an amazing producer so I thought she would have told me to do somethiiiing!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
I mean, you've been acting kind of reserved this whole time...so what's up with you?

You've been moving away from us really slowly and you haven't joined the conversation this whole time either.

Or, is it just that you don't wanna help the oh-so-awful "Crazy:B" even if we're allied?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
It's not like that! I have nothing against "Crazy:B"! In fact I even sympathize with you all since we debuted as newcomers around the same time...!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
That so. Well, that's a problem...I know this sounds contradictory but you'd be better off not getting too friendly with us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
No, um! I'd personally rather it if I got to know you all more actually! It would be an all around disaster if we were to start something with you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
...? Well, I dunno about you, but I'm hoping we can see eye-to-eye at least during work.

C'mon, let's shake hands~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
Kyaaaaah?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
....You scared me! The hell...don't scream so suddenly.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
I'm sorryyyy! I'm just not good with being surprised! That was just the sound of my reason and instinct grinding together!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Some heart of steel <i>you’ve</i> got.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
I'm throwing a shield of reason in front of my instincts that want to let looseeee! Ahhh, but it's just too fragile and unsounnnd...!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
This is pretty grim. I can't even hold a proper conversation.

Yesterday, Niki-han was paired up with you and did a good job with the work, right? He’s a surprisingly capable guy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
I actually have no idea how we got the OK yesterday either! That's why now, after being asked to help Tatsumi-san, I'm at a loss…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
.......
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
Ah, Tatsumi-san! Tatsumi-saa~aan! It's Mayoi!

Uuuu, I was having a really difficult time walking around and talking with people I'm not familiar with! But, Tatsumi-san, when I saw you all my fears melted away!

After all, Tatsumi-san is a cherished person who always saves even someone like me~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Mayoi-san. Anzu-san and...Kohaku-san, was it? Good morning to you all.
{% endbubble %}

![yup](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c37661b050b5406a4e1b3d8c1c5f0f46/8c6d33ddf76a9ae8-7a/s2048x3072/77dc9f5f2e7806d99659160a3fb9cf1ef78f319b.png)

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Yep, morning. Hm? Wasn't HiMERU-han with you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Haaa...we ran into a bit of trouble.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
<th><i>(Uuu! I want to hide in Tatsumi-san's shadow and be embraced in the tenderness that always radiates from him! Ahh, but if I do anything like that now, I'll just look ridiculous...!)</i></th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
? What's the matter, Mayoi-san? You're fidgeting a lot.

You told me in advance about it, but it seems like you really brought wonderful helping hands, Anzu-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
What do you mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Let's see here. Surely the both of you have already been informed but yesterday our pairing--"HiMERU x Kazehaya Tatsumi"--failed to get an OK for the entire time.

As a result, the job was left unfinished.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
So that's how it is. I wonder what HiMERU-han got shy about, he didn't tell us anything so we were left completely in the dark about it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Fufu. HiMERU-san is someone who takes pride in his work, so I'm certain he wasn't too keen about confiding in others about the mistake.

It was that way for me and the other "ALKALOID" members as well, as I tend to take the role of a big brother capable of anything.

But since things aren't that way anymore, I feel better now that I can tell them everything.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
Uuu, so bright....You're so optimistic Tatsumi-san. So strong and unphased by everything. Ahh, I want to rest against you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
As far as I'm concerned, that's not any of your fault. You really can't do much about it unless the boss gives the OK.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Yes, it was something truly troublesome. Even though yesterday we put in a lot of effort, we weren't able to get anything to work out.

And so, we came to the conclusion that just working through it on our own wouldn't work, so we consulted with Anzu-san after we'd already talked to her on another matter yesterday.

I was lost on what to do. We were really grasping at straws.<sup>**(10)**</sup>

{% bubble Tatsumi%}
And so, Anzu-san was able to intervene fast. 

She quickly contacted the director--and then came up with a solution. Basically, "maybe the pairing is inadequate" is what they concluded.

With me and HiMERU-san together, we can't quite properly act like "characters in a dating simulator". So, we thought we would be better off pairing up instead with our close friends.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
And that's why you called us, as pairing candidates.

Well, HiMERU-han is pretty hard on Rinne-han and Niki-han, but he's got some sort of soft spot for me.

I wonder if he'd have trouble showing fondness, much less be able to act like a "character in a dating sim".
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi%}
Yes. Though I'm still unsure if that would be the "correct" answer, since the director seems to have a peculiar set of morals.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
But still, it's better than doing the same thing in circles. If you keep trying your luck until you hit a jackpot then you'll have to win eventually for sure.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
Ah, right! I'm not sure how I'm going to be able to assist, but I'll make sure to do my best! Uuu! Tatsumi-san probably considers me a close friend for "ALKALOID" so that must mean he called me for that reason! I couldn't be more honored, I'm so happy I feel as if I could collapse!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi%}
Not exactly, I let Anzu-san choose. She's a talented producer, so I trusted she'd be able to pick the "correct" combinations.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
I-is that so?! I'm sorry for getting so excited over a misunderstandingggg!

I was full of myself for thinking that I was the only special one, but Tatsumi-san you have love for all beings, don't you?!

Apologies for acting unusually. Unfortunately, HiMERU hadn't been feeling well so he went to the restroom in that convenience store there for a bit.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Are you okay? Now that you mention it, you don't look too hot HiMERU-han...?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Yes, it doesn't affect HiMERU's behavior so he is fine. He doesn't want to stay any longer in this ridiculous situation either, so let's finish this today.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
R-right...? Just take it easy, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
(How careless....Telling Tatsumi about HiMERU's condition and asking for his assistance may have been a mistake.)

(In order for HiMERU to fix this whole situation, he would have to "win over" someone to beat the game. His theory is that by doing so, his brain will finally realize the game is over and return to reality.)

(Since there was no one else around, HiMERU supposed he'd try to "win over" Tatsumi, but in order to do that, he’d have to increase his affinity.)

(Once the affinity is high enough, one could propose to the other and vice-versa. If both sides are consenting and they accept the proposal, then the marriage is complete.)

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi%}
But I'm having such a good time though…

It's not as bad nowadays, but specifically growing up I never truly had a close connection with anyone.

Now that I'm thinking about it, I'm pretty sure I'm living a lonelier life than I thought. Is it because I've never had a close relationship with someone that I'm unable to act in a romantic way?

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Just so you know. Anzu-han is gonna be off to the side somewhere filming with some special equipment.

Just act natural and don't be too uptight about the camera being around. That's probably the correct answer you keep looking for too. If you try acting, it's just gonna feel forced, so you're better off just doing as you normally do.

That's how me and Love-han got the "OK" yesterday too, we just talked like normal. I don't really get any of the reasoning behind it, but what the director says goes I guess.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
--If "Ai-stars" is meant to be a dating simulator between men and women, then wouldn't it be more efficient to create a pairing with Anzu-san?

HiMERU was also unfamiliar with "men whispering sweet nothings to each other", so he wasn't able to act well without enough information.

Though if a pairing with Anzu-san was created, there would at least be a specific way to act. There's multiple examples to follow from existing books and movies.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
See, that's what I said, but it turns out Anzu-han isn't comfortable with it. She doesn't like the idea of Producers misusing their power against idols or something.

That's the exact premise of "Ai-stars" though.

Yes. Though I must feel grateful since she's doing so much to help us despite this not being her issue ro begin with.

Anzu-san is truly a wonderful Producer. Seeing as we're indebted to her, we as idols should complete this task with all we have.

Kokoko~ Those two over there seem pretty chummy don't they? I suppose we'd have to act our part in a chummy scene too, but I'm not too keen on that kinda thing.

I meant to ask Love-han about it yesterday since he seemed to know a bunch about that kinda thing, but we got the "OK" while we were distracted talking about something else...I really just don't get it.

So I'm not really sure what to do. HiMERU-han, maybe you could tell me? HiMERU-han, you know I'd help you out in any way I can, right? Do you need to hold hands? Hey, hey?

What are you on about?! Just what is going <i>on</i> with you lately, HiMERU-han? Maybe you should take a break?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
--No. HiMERU and Tatsumi are the main focuses of this activity, so we can't possibly leave.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
If you say so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Seeing as you and the others came all the way here, Oukawa, getting this done today needs to be ensured no matter the cost.

--So please don't worry, HiMERU is a professional.

Hold on, wasn't the reason we had to come out here to begin with because “the professional” was rusty?<sup>**(14)**</sup>

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Ufufu. Seems like this is really running you through the dirt, HiMERU-han.

Kokoko~ Maybe this isn't the best time to say so, but I'm kind of glad. You really don't show when you're having trouble at all, HiMERU-han. You definitely don't show emotions like anger or envy either.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
....Because HiMERU is an idol. The best and the most perfect in the world.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Yeah. Maybe so, but "Crazy:B" aren't really perfect idols.

Take Niki-han, for example. He's always thinking about food like a kid or animal.

And then there's Rinne-han, who's always got something to be pissed at, but he swallows it and calmly puts a plan together. He's like a steam engine that's got a roaring flame in him, and that's what keeps him going.

We've only been able to come this far being tugged along by a guy like him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
--Just what are you trying to say, Oukawa?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Basically, our leader Rinne-han would never ignore the fire that's in us. If anything, he'd actually just fuel it even more.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
I've always been angry too.

At the annoyances of day to day life. At this unfair world. At my family's disturbing business. At the smiles of my parents and sisters, that always felt forced. Everything I hated I wanted to get rid of.

Rinne-han, and the rest of you at Crazy:B, accepted such an ugly side of me. I was allowed to be angry and to kick and scream like a spoiled brat.

All those people that say "don't be an eyesore, don't be shameful" and force our heads down, they're our enemies.

Niki-han's taught me a thing or two lately too. We can be more like him and follow our desires more. His way of living is the "correct" answer for "Crazy:B". It's part of the reason why Rinne-han loves him so much--and accepts him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
No, Amagi seems to be the hardest on Shiina.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Kokoko~ That just means Rinne-han's not afraid to be himself too, right? He just lives however he wants without a care.

I want to live that way too...but I can't force you to do that, HiMERU-han.

I don't know what type of person you are, what you like or what you hate…I still don't know a thing about you yet, HiMERU-han.

(13): Yes, Tatsumi does in fact use the word for "married people" here KHFDS Mayoi does so right after as well.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
Eh? Didn't you notice at all? Tatsumi-san, you grabbed my hand and pulled me to all kinds of stores endlessly, and made me try all sorts of beautiful clothes--I was made into a mannequin! 

Not only that, I was pulled into doing things you wanted to do like arcade games and karaoke!

I can't take any more! I've been drained of my strength! I'm completely exhausted!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
I-I didn't even realize that...I'm sorry to have put you through my "fun", Mayoi-san.

I assumed that if I was having fun then you must have been too. It seems that wasn't the case.

I repent. Ohh, I've succumbed to desires at Mayoi-san's expense.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
N-no, that's not it! It was a great and dandy time for me too, but there are <i>limits</i>! I’m just tired....!

I'm a human being too, and I can easily break down if I keep getting tossed abouuuut!

It would've been a problem if she hadn't…

I know it was the whole point of this project, but Tatsumi-san kept whispering words of adoration to me at every turn. A-and that's probably why my ears have gone numb…

Maybe so! But you needed to say <i>yes</i>!

Oukawa's affinity wouldn't rise above a specific level for some reason, so Tatsumi you were the only option!

{% bubble HiMERU %}
In "Ai-stars", when you raise someone's affinity to 100 you can ask to marry them, and if both parties are in agreement then you get married.

...We can never know what's in someone else's heart. For games this might be true, but this is reality.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Is that so! What a relief! Congratulations! So clearing the game really was the cure for your symptoms after all?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Probably...It could also be that the symptoms wore off with time naturally.

Even when wearing glasses that flip your vision upside down, your brain will correct your vision with time to the way it previously was.

That's just how the human brain works. Over time it will adapt and perceive the world normally again.

A constant state of confusion and illusion simply doesn't exist.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
That's right. If you're ever seeing things that aren't actually there, then that would just mean there's an issue with part of your brain functions. 

However, you will always be perfect, good, and righteous.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Hmph. What's "normal" and what's "right" or not is all dependent on personal beliefs.

If you keep treating others reverently like that you'll only face failure again, Tatsumi.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
I'll keep that in mind.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Fufu. HiMERU is also adapting, albeit slowly, to this strange world. A rather dull world, where there's nothing to love.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Yes. I'll assist you as much as possible, anytime. As your reliable "husband".
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
No. The game is over, so it's fine to go back to the same relationship we had before. That is to say, as <i>"strangers"</i>.

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Yes. That day, in the alleyway HiMERU proposed all for the sake of "Ai-stars"s recording.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Yeah…we got worried when you two didn’t come back right away, so we went to check up on you and saw but…

You both were there, standing scandalously close to each other and whispering lovey words–
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
It was *not* scandalous, and we were *not* whispering love to each other.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
S-sure it wasn’t. Me and Mayoi-han got a little unsettled, even now we get a little on edge when we see you, HiMERU-han.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Oya, could you be jealous, Oukawa?

Please don’t worry. Of everyone in ES, HiMERU’s affinity for you is the highest.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
What even is all this affinity talk anyways? It’s ridiculous…and besides, HiMERU-han, it’s your fault for being so confusing.

If Anzu-san isn’t around filming anymore then keeping up the act of a "character from a dating sim” is pointless isn’t it.

You’re giving me the impression that you’re serious about this…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Impossible. It’s awful even to think about.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
<th><i>(Though, it’s true we came up with a poor excuse.)</th></i>

<th><i>(Oukawa came to check on us because he’d gotten worried, and subsequently saw HiMERU and Tatsumi standing close to each other. We had to rush to explain ourselves.)</th></i>

<th><i>(Thankfully, Anzu-san had come to find us sooner and was able to record–)</th></i>

<th><i>(Yes, she had recording equipment with her, and as a result she was able to submit a video that the client was happy with.)</th></i>

<th><i>(They said “Yes, yes! This is exactly what we wanted! Two men, usually calm and composed, exposing their true instincts–” and were satisfied. Whatever that means.)</th></i>

<th><i>(Arguably, it’d be better to fire a crazy person like them as quickly as possible.)</th></i>

{% bubble HiMERU %}
<th><i>(Well, the fact that the job was done perfectly and excellently as HiMERU always does should be a relief.)</th></i>

<th><i>(It was a chaotic, but certainly rewarding, experience. God is in heaven, and all's right with the world<sup>**(15)**</sup>. This can be called a happy ending.)</th></i>

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
HiMERU-saaaaan~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Oh, your “husband” is here to pick you up.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
HiMERU: That kind of joke is *unforgivable*, Oukawa.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Scary…

Did you need anything from us, Tatsumi-han? I heard you guys are still booked. Are you sure it’s okay to be spending time here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
Fufu. It’s not okay actually, but…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Oh, Mayoi-han you’re here too. Hi there~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
Ah, yes! Hello, Koha-kyun…~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Koha-kyun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
I-I’m sorry! I misspoke!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Did you really? Well, nevermind that. HiMERU was simply offering Oukawa a meal as thanks for helping before.

You both were also useful with help and are welcome to join us if you’d like. Shiina went a little overboard in making the food so we can’t possibly eat it ourselves.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Ah, that’s nice of you, but it was also something we had to do for our sake, so please don’t feel indebted to us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Yes. We have the same position of work. We’re equals, so there’s no debt involved. And so, please allow HiMERU to show his gratitude with this meal.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
No point in arguing Mayoi-han, let HiMERU-han buy you something.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
I-if you insist...in actuality, we’ve been so busy lately that all we’ve had to eat are bento boxes and things like that, so I’d be happy to finally eat a proper meal.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Good. Come sit here~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Fufu. I feel like I’ve been able to gain a better understanding of everyone in “Crazy:B”. It took a lot of hard work, but I believe it was also a good experience.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Yes, HiMERU thought the same. HiMERU will keep gaining more experience in order to better himself as an idol.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Wonderful. I actually have some good news for Crazy:B–specifically, for HiMERU-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
For HiMERU? What is it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
It would appear that our first Valentine’s Day event “Ai-stars” was received well by the public. So much that the producer was excited enough to begin working on a sequel event, without anyone asking them to do so.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
“Sequel”…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Yes. To align with June Bride, the sequel will be titled “Tatsumi and HiMERU’s Lovey Lovey*Newlywed Life”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
…….
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
We’ve been offered roles, what will you do?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
–Obviously, politely refuse~
{% endbubble %}
