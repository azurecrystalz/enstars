{% bubble Kohaku %}

  <th>*(HiMERU-han's scrolling through his phone, and it looks like he's in a pretty good mood.)*</th>
  
  <th>*(Is he looking at newbie job posts again? I think it was sometime in the summer when he said that seeing "earnesty" made him smile.<sup>**(1)**</sup> And like I said before, I just don't get it. I really don't understand that kind of hobby...)*</th>
  
  <th>*(Oops. This isn't any time for me to be escaping reality and being on my computer. I've got a problem on my hands.)*</th>
  
  <th>*(No other way to do this comes to mind, so I'm just gonna...)*</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
—Hey, HiMERU-han. I wanna ask you for a bit of advice, do you have a sec?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Yes, what is it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Actually, I was finally called about my "personalized costume", and when I said that I had no idea about idol costumes, Anzu-han said that we should think about it together.

"Crazy:B" is pretty far removed from all the other "units" Anzu-han compared us to, so I don't wanna rely too much on that. I told her that I would get back to her after I came up with a few ideas of my own, then we went off our own ways.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
...And? Have you come up with any ideas?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Nope. I thought I could try it on my own and I’d have it under control, but I'm not getting anywhere. I've never even thought of designing my own costumes before, so I haven't got a clue.

So, I need a bit of advice. HiMERU-han, if you were me, then what kind of costume would I pick?
{% endbubble %}

![difficult](https://64.media.tumblr.com/76de874cd0cb477721a8ea84da2da207/269c520ab98a640e-c5/s1280x1920/11be7841cb7ea483588a780c3195e0bb97ff9931.png)

{% bubble HiMERU %}
That's a difficult question. HiMERU is HiMERU, and he isn't anyone else.

The same would apply to you. Wouldn't it be best to try asking this question to yourself?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Duh. But, if I could do that, then I wouldn't be having such a tough time…

I think it'd be better if idols wore western clothing, but I've also always worn kimonos at home so I really don't know what's what.

"Outerwear" and "innerwear" are all fancy words I didn't know until I moved here, y’know? It's all so complicated.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
No need to daunt yourself. If all the choices were truly infinite, then everyone would also be lost.

You should take your time in thinking about it. You don't really need to decide today or tomorrow, since it's "Oukawa Kohaku's personalized outfit".

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
I get that, but if I can't come up with anything then what should I do? I don't want to spend all my time worrying about it…
{% endbubble %}

![yo](https://64.media.tumblr.com/fd993c3408cea90bf0465feba751a5da/269c520ab98a640e-18/s1280x1920/bc2dd9c7e75eedb163528413be9b62d93d6dd62c.png)

{% bubble Rinne %}
Yo, Kohaku-chan! Rinne-kun is here to give you a hand~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Ugh. The number one person I didn't want involved at all showed up.

I hate it when you involve yourself in things, because everything just gets even more complicated.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
"Number one" you say, I'm so loved~

So, I hear you're having trouble crafting up a "personalized outfit", right?

I'll come up with something unique. Here, hand over your sketchbook.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Rinne-han will help? I dunno what I should expect.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Gyahaha! Just leave it to me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}

   <th>*(It's hard to see anything from here. He's just humming and drawing smoothly. Fashion sense, I think is what it's called? Does he have a good fashion sense?)*</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
♪〜♪〜♪

There, all done.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Where...

What's with that weird looking outfit? For some reason, it looks a little like Rinne-han's "personalized outfit". I don't like it much.

If I showed up to a "Crazy:B" live in this, people will just think we're wearing the same outfit.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Heh, "Crazy:B"'s live huh…

You remember when I said "when everyone's personalized outfits are ready, we'll all wear them and put on a live"<sup>**(2)**</sup>? You're pretty sharp, Kohaku-chan~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Th-that's not it. We're part of the same "unit", so I just thought that the opportunity might come up for us to do that one day–
{% endbubble %}

![waiting](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3eee0896b1f322776728f70a92fb8aa7/269c520ab98a640e-dd/s1280x1920/9715d4c3a44fca66855b6b24ed101a5e4568aaf2.png)

{% bubble Niki %}
Thank you for waiting. Here's hashbrowns for four~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Isn't this a bit much for four people?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Don't worry about that, because I'll eat half of it! Thank you for the meal~

Mogumogu...I overheard something about "personalized outfits", so I guess it's Kohaku-chan's turn next. What kind of outfit are you going to wear?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
I'm still trying to figure out what I'm gonna do, but I really can't come up with anything…

Niki-han, what do you think?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Uuuun. If I had to pick, then I’d definitely choose colorful clothes. If it was plain white, it'd just get dirty when I cook.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
That would help you, Shiina, but it wouldn't really apply to Oukawa's case, correct?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Yup, yup. That's why I can't really come up with ideas and help answer any questions~

Fashion isn't really my forte! Whenever I buy new clothes, I just ask the shopkeeper to help me find things that would look good on me…

So, if you're really worried about it, Kohaku-chan, then why don't you just let professionals help? That would be your best bet.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}

   <th>*(In other words, I really should just leave it up to Anzu-han? That's no good. If I rely on her, then I'd be back to where I started. Well, it's not like I'm getting anywhere here...)*</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
I'll go think of "personalized outfit" ideas somewhere else. Niki-han, you can eat my share.
{% endbubble %}

   <th>*(I tried borrowing an idol magazine from the office to use as a reference...but all the clothes in it have already been worn by someone else, and I don't think any of them would fit me much.)*</th>

   <th>*("I want you to design as freely as you want" is what Anzu-han told me, but I can't even put a single line down.)*</th>

   <th>*(Is this what it means to have freedom valued this much nowadays...? Isn't it just becoming an obstacle...?)*</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
Oukawa-shi, how is the design process coming along?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Vice Prez-han, Nagisa-han...
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
Fumu. It appears as though you've hit a deadlock<sup>**(3)**</sup>.

Well then, since I'm a member of the same agency, I'd like to offer you a bit of advice from a "producer" standpoint.

If the design is meant to be about the idol themselves, then why not give incorporating "amber"<sup>**(4)**</sup> into the design a try?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Amber...? Isn't that just sap with dead insects in it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
...That may be true, but that's not all there is to it...This piece of amber is for you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Nn? Thanks... Oh, that's not a bug, but a flower right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
Yes. It's speculated to have bloomed around ten million years ago.

To begin with, the flower was wiped off the earth a long time ago–but since it was protected by the sap, it can be sustained for a very long time.

...Amber is a stone of miracles.
{% endbubble %}

<h4>Translation Notes</h4>

(1): This thought line here is referencing chapter 1 of the story “Honeybee”! HiMERU was looking at newbie jobs and talked about how seeing inexperienced idols quickly try to take every job they see was charming!

(2): This is referring to the end of Rinne’s FS1 story!

—Who's there!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
Fufufu. It's me, Koha-kun~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Bon…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
So, I heard from Ran-senpai. You're having trouble mulling over your "personalized outfit", right?

Poor Koha-kun. It's alright now, since Tsukasa-onii-chan came to help. Now, wipe up those tears.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
I am not crying, and I don't need any of your help.

We're in different agencies. Go back to yours if you're not here for anything business related.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
Koha-kun and I are inseparable. There there, you can leave this to me~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Don’t come sit next to me, it’s bumming me out.

Haaa…I’ll cave, but just this once. I’ve got no choice but to turn to my roots.

Even if it’s you, Bon, any little bit of help is useful.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
Ufufun, it’s good to be honest~…

By the way, my “personalized outfit” is—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
You don’t need to show it to me. I know what it looks like.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
Really?! Koha-kun and my outfit…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
While I was doing a bit of research for personalized outfits, I just stumbled upon it.

The western design didn’t really meet what I had in mind, but…it looked fine on you, Bon.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
To be complimented by you…I’m thrilled. _Marvelous!_
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
I was complimenting the outfit, not you, Bon.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
Still, it made me happy to hear that. Thank you.

Now then—enough idle talk, shall we talk about your “personalized outfit”, Koha-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Why do you get to be the one in charge, Bon…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
Fufu, because I’m your “Onii-chan”~

For the _Design_, I think a Japanese style kimono would fit you best, Koha-kun. And if you give it a sakura _Motif_, then wouldn’t that make it a beautiful outfit?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Don’t you know I’m just a kid of the branch family<sup>**(5)**</sup>? I can’t carry something like sakura.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
This matter has nothing to do with being in the main or branch families.

Sakura is not some ordinary concept. There are hundreds of different types of sakura. I have mine, and Koha-kun has his.

Each sakura blossom should be unique. Why don’t you make your own kind of sakura blossoms bloom for your _Fans_?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
…Even though you're just a kid, Bon, you’re so arrogant.

My own kind of sakura, huh…

I always thought sakura blossoms only lasted for a quick second before fluttering away, but…

{% bubble Kohaku %}
...Even if it's just for a fleeting second, can someone like me bloom beautifully like that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
Absolutely. It will stay in the hearts of your _Fans_ not just for a second, but forever. I want that for me, too.

Please show me your own type of sakura.

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Zzzz...zzzz....
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Nyahaha. Seems like he's fast asleep~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
As an idol, he acts all grown up. But when he's asleep like this he really looks his age.

What a cute little sleepy face (poke poke).
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Hey. He's sleeping peacefully, so don't poke him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
His "personalized outfit" design...looks like it's finished.

Sakura and amber…it’s certainly an outfit only he could wear.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Right. It's a nice looking fit, not any lesser than what we have.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
<i>(muttering in sleep)</i><sup>**(6)**</sup> Just what're you on about…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
...Could it be, is he actually awake?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Nope. Just sleep-talking.

Gyahaha! So that leaves just Niki, right? Once the four of us have our "personalized outfits", that's when the party will start!

Let's go out flying endlessly and making some noise on stage, Kohaku-chan!

<!-- Translation Notes -->

<h4>Translation Notes</h4>

(3): Different from a deadend, a deadlock is when someone is stuck going in circles.

(4): Word play of sorts? “琥珀” is “kohaku”, meaning “amber” (a type of gemstone), which obviously has a connection to Kohaku’s name.

(5): For those unaware of Kohaku and Tsukasa’s relationship as cousins. The Suous are the “main family” and the Oukawas are the “side family” that lived in the same estate.

(6): The onomatopoeia for this written was “むにゃむにゃ”/“muniya muniya” but I left it like this for clarity purposes.
