**Quick Note:** Esu uses a bit of onomatopoeias in the beginning and <i>normally</i>  I would type them out as is so that you could see the quirky bits in action but just for this story I’ll translate them and any text <span style="color:#9f9fff"><b>like this in purple</b></span> marks his use of an onomatopoeia!

{% bubble Esu %}
Now, let’s get this adventure started!!!!

Today’s adventure issss…<th>drum rooooooll~!</th>

To close my eyes, pick a drink from the console, and drink whatever random concoction comes out!

The adventure is a go! <th>Go! Go! <i>Go!</i></th>

Keep the adventure going! <th>Glug glug glug glug~</th>

Ugh! Adventure☆Failed….!!!!

…Hm. Well actually, maybe not. Sure, I <i>did</i> drink something that was so bad my tongue and stomach are killing me, buuuut that doesn’t mean it was <i>totally</i> a failure.

Something like this will definitely help me be more strapping and handsome!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Esu %}
How do you like <i>that?</i> Whaddya think, Onee-san?

Eh? You don’t know how to answer such a sudden question?

Riiiiiiight~! I think so too! I’ve been thinking that this whole time! I’ve been thinking that since the age of the <i>dinosaurs</i> actually! Hiyahahahaha!

Ah! Wait, please! Don’t back up like that?! Don’t look at me like I’m weird either, I’m sorry!

I drank something that tasted like chemicals so my brain was all in a twist!

Quit calling for security, please! I’ll really be in trouble then! Would a dogeza<sup>**(1)**</sup> work? Would it make you feel better if I begged you on my knees?! Craaaaaap!

But wait! I’m destined to be the man who will rule all mankind…! I never bow down to anyone–

{% bubble Esu %}
Argh~! Fine, fine! I’m sorry! I begged on my knees! Happy now?!

Jeez! You’re so spoiled! Like a spoiled little princess!

Oh right, wasn’t there a show that went like that? Around five years ago<sup>**(2)**</sup>?

My creepy freeloader kept yapping with complaints like “oh the princess isn’t well portrayed” while watching the show all the time!

If you’re gonna keep griping about it so much, then why dontcha just stop watching! Don’t you think so? ‘Cuz that's what <i>I</i> think! Actually, I was the <i>first</i> person in all of <i>mankind</i> to ever think so!!!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Esu %}
Hm? Who am I, you’re asking? Come to think of it, we’ve never met before have we…?

I’m Sagiri Esu! I’m gonna be the man that climbs to the top of the idol industry...!

The higher the mountain, the better the climb! Isn’t that right, Onee-san?

Not really, you say…Well, that makes the score even then. 1 point for (Esu), 1 point opposed (Onee-san).

This is getting super excitinnnnnggg~! Hiyahahahaha!

Ah, I’ll stop! I don’t want to get in trouble! Please don’t call security!

I begged you not to do that earlier, didn’t I? Cut me some slack, will you?! Would money work? Do you need money?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Esu %}
Eh, you think I’m super energetic? Well, that <i>is</i> my selling point!

When we’re talking about staying healthy, us Sagiri’s have been experts at that since my ol’ grandpappy was around. That was all thanks to the power of Sagiri Pharmaceuticals!

What’s Sagiri Pharmaceuticals? Where’d that come from? Onee-san, do you have any idea?

By the way, who’re you, Onee-san? Hm, Anzu-san the “Producer” huh…

Sorry, never heard of that name before!

After all, this is the first time we’ve met! I’ve got a special talent that lets me memorize the names and faces of everyone I’ve met on the first try!

Oh, and I’m also good at mountain climbing and setting up campsites. Barbeques too!

Speaking of the outdoors, Japan’s top player ☆ for the Camping Competition will be me, Sagiri Esu!

{% bubble Esu %}
Eh, you think every single thing I’m saying is so exaggerated it's funny?

Well it’s go big or go home, isn’t it! When you see something big like mountains, oceans, forests, or even the heavens, you’d get excited too, right?

Buuut, small things have their charms too, don’t they? I can’t say no to them, either! I never reject anything, ‘cuz I’m a man who aims for the sun then swallows everything up to grow!

Waaait, wouldn’t a black hole be more appropriate for that description than a sun? Don’t black holes have a bad association with them?

No, I'm being prejudiced! I, Sagiri Esu, have misjudged! Should I feel bad for every black hole in the universe now?!

Nope, don’t think so! End of story!!!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Esu %}
…Hm? Do you have something you wanna say, Onee-san?

Right. Then I’ll be quiet. I won’t be able to hear you if I keep making a racket.

Not to worry, I’m a man pretty well known for being <i>really</i> quiet when I’m quiet!

……….

Mhm. Mhm. Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm!

Eh? I’m being noisy?! Wasn’t that what I was trying <i>not</i> to do? You sure don’t look pleased!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Esu %}
If I reflect, get down on my knees, and pay money, will you be happy then?!

Ohhhh, right right. Onee-san, you’re here to pick me up, aren’t you?

Is it because some big “producer” is calling me back for a chance for some “audition”?

Right, right! That’s the whole reason why I showed up at ES.

I was so caught up in trying to get away from Fuyume and the fact that I hadn’t gone on an adventure today that I completely forgot about that!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Esu %}
‘Kay. Then, let’s go. Wait, where exactly are we going?!

If you don’t tell me, then I’m just gonna end up spending each and every one of the days I have left in my life crossing out all the options!

The conference room? Roger! Thanks for going through the trouble to tell me!!!!

Ah, yelling so much made me thirsty.

<th>Glug glug glug glug glug…</th>

Hey, this drink is actually kinda tasty now that I’ve tried it again.

–Meaning, today’s adventure was a success!

<h4>Translation Footnotes</h4>

**(1):** A japanese body language gesture one would use when trying to show reverence to someone above them or offer a deep apology for something; In which a person gets on their knees and presses their head to the ground.
**(2):** Might be reaching but I <i>think</i> this could be referencing either “Rosicrucian” or “Cinderella Show” (Basic era Tomoya centric stories), I’m only hesitant since I can’t particularly remember if those were theater performances or televised programs (or both). If anyone has any insight do feel free to let me know.

**TL Notes:** Couple of things! Firstly, since the story is voiced, I tried to match his attitude/tone and express it as much as possible through writing so that you can get a feel for his character. Additionally, after discussing it with Mika, I feel like it’s worth mentioning that Esu's speech is Interesting. Namely, the way he phrases things is strange and, in my point of view, a bit convoluted in a really fun way. It could tie back to how he talks about how he’s bad at communicating in his second idol story.
