  {% bubble Jun %}
    Oiii. Sakura-kuuun~? Are you ok?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    .... *(Waves his hands around)*
  {% endbubble %}


  {% bubble Jun %}
    I'm a bit relieved that you have at least the energy to respond somehow. You've been pretty fatigued lately, haven't you?
    
    You didn't come back here to our room the last time you stayed over, and the past couple of days you've been coming home late. Are you busy doing work?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    No. It's not work. Recently I've been having a really hard time trying to get prepared for "ES Halloween"...
    
    Well, I guess it's my fault that I'm not able to fare well.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    <th>*(I really did just end up getting scared so many times that I got used to it. My spirit's been drained.)*</th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Jun %}
    "ES Halloween"?
    
    —Aah, are you saying you're tired from the practice for the event?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Well, kinda. It was more like training than practice.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Jun %}
    Hm?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Nothing. It's nothing. It was our own thing, so you don't need to worry about it.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Jun %}
    Fuu~n. So, "ES Halloween" is gonna have "Crazy:B" participating in it? I'm pretty excited about it, since it looks like it's gonna be a huge deal. That Ibara guy seemed to be looking forward to it too.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    It *is* a seasonal event. So it's true that the director's been bustling. This has to be the best time to make money.
  {% endbubble %}


  {% bubble Jun %}
    Right, right. That's exactly it. Ohii-san and Nagi-senpai were really anticipating the costume party.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![costumes…](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a392de4a161e049cbbf24913f42c7ce8/cf33196ea172ad87-8b/s2048x3072/a5f1b353da5022699fe68d5e3aa77d9095991410.pnj)

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Uuu… costumes…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Jun %}
    ? What's wrong?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    No. It's nothing.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Jun %}
    But, I'm surprised. Sakura-kun's group is actually really kind.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Hah? Kind? Who is?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Jun %}
    Ah, nono. It's just how I saw it, so please don't be so offended…
    
    "Crazy:B" always seemed like the kind of "unit" that would just go with their own flow to me. I thought the fact that they excitedly helped you with lessons when you couldn't do well was actually super kind, Sakura-kun…it was a liiiitle unexpected.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![relief](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e12d1dd9788fa50c4a327b43d28fcd43/cf33196ea172ad87-88/s2048x3072/b3d64f8a8c2e97f1d7d599cf700a63e0445e0600.pnj)

  {% bubble Jun %}
    That's a relief. Sakura-kun, you're the youngest in "Crazy:B". So I'm happy you have people around to take care of you.
    
    Think of it this way: here at Reimei there's not many older students right? It's pretty much the definition of "the law of the jungle"<sup>**(1)**</sup>.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    ...........
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Jun %}
    ? What's wrong? You look surprised.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Nothing. I just never thought of it that way before. Is that how it is?
    
    I just thought Rinne-han was getting a laugh out of it.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Jun %}
    Ahaha. It's hard to tell when it's all about you right? Ohii-san is really hyper, egotistical, and really rash, but he does take good care of me, and that's surprising.
    
    Isn't it the same in your group, Sakura-kun?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    In mine...?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Jun %}
    I've always thought that if I'd ever went wrong somewhere, then I'd still be alone.
    
    To be surrounded by people like this is something I'm really grateful for… and I need to remember to stay grateful for those around me.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    ......
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Jun %}
    Well, if I ever told that to Ohii-san then he'd definitely get carried away. So, I'm not saying a thing.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Fufu. What's with that? What would be the point in telling them? I really *am* surrounded by dishonest people.

  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Nn? My stomach is rumbling. It's noon already, and I really am hungry…
    
    I want to see if I could grab a bite from the kitchen since I was too lazy to go out and buy groceries, but… Nn? What smells sweet?
  {% endbubble %}

  ![~~~](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b7056511dad1c05f73a8082557b8b1f3/4dcdcde1b1218713-67/s2048x3072/e90ba46a6fd9b7c7696a591d762b0aa5b83b2e59.pnj)

  {% bubble Niki %}
    ~........
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    I thought I caught a whiff of something sweet, turns out it's just Niki-han? Are you cooking something up again?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Ah! Kohaku-chan, good morning!
    
    You're right. What I'm making now is a prototype batch of Halloween cookies. There's plenty, Kohaku-chan, so you can eat some too.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Halloween cookies? Ah, that's true. There's a bunch of cookies that have the shapes of bats, pumpkins, and ghosts. I'll gladly take some since I'm so hungry. Thanks~ 
    
    Nn! They're so good. As expected of you, Niki-han.
    
    Still, even though I'm the one that got something good out of this, why don't you make all these prototypes on the day of production instead of going through all this trouble now? Niki-han, you're too stubborn when it comes to cooking.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Ah, these all aren't for me. I mentioned how "Cinnamon"’s manager was super thrilled about the Halloween event, didn't I~?
    
    At "Cinnamon", I was really excited to sell gift batches of cookies on that same day. That's why we're making a bunch of prototypes.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Fuu~n. I get it now. I've been wondering about it for a while, Niki-han, but you really look like you love Halloween. I can tell you're enjoying yourself.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    That's right! When "Trick or Treat" is all you have to say to get a load of goodies from everyone around, it's like a dream! It could be Halloween everyday.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Yikes. I hope the end is soon…I'll never live a day of peace.
    
    Nn? I had no idea that they wrapped up Halloween candy all cute-like. Using scary motifs or black and orange colors would make it more Halloween-like, wouldn't it?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    You're not wrong~, but I've heard Halloween has been changing more and more lately.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Changing...?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    The whole idea of Halloween used to be "giving out candy in exchange for not getting pranked", but now it's more like more people want to "give sweets to the ones who've taken good care of them".
    
    Like you know how Valentine's Day got more popular and you could give your friends chocolate? It looks like Halloween is becoming more like that, where you're simply all having fun together.
    
    So that's why, in order for it to be useful as a gift, I'm using the cute wrapping.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![to the ones…](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5aabdc9966df189caff90d04e4a978a1/4dcdcde1b1218713-33/s2048x3072/88c5da9c55439d98476d3752aa21c629d603414a.pnj)

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Fuu~n. Is it really popular to do something like that nowadays?…
    
    "To the ones who've taken good care of them"...huh…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    ......
    
    Hey, Niki-han. Those cookies, I want to bake them too. Can you teach me how?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Eh? I don't mind that but…that's odd. If you say so Kohaku-chan. But does that mean there's someone you want to gift these cookies to?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    —Well, something like that. I know it's unusual.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Ehhh~? That's not truuuuue. I'm happy if I can cook with someone since it's fun. We've got plenty of wrapping paper, so let's make something that you'll like together.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Right. I'm in your care, Niki-han.
