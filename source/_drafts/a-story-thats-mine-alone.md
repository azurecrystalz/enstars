{% bubble Mao %}
—Huh? My bad, Kagehira. Looks like something fell off the desk when I walked by you. Is this a design sketch?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Nnah, I'm the one who's sorry. I was the one spreading things all over your desk, sorry for bothering you.<sup>**(1)**</sup>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Nono, you really don't need to apologize, since I was the one who dropped it.

At any rate, why are you even spreading out all your design sketches...? There's ribbons, beads, and stuff too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Nn, well… I'm preparing things for my "Feature Live" right now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Fumu, do you mean you're making props for the live?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Right. I went and asked Anzu-chan if I could make the costume and props for the live. I'm kinda nervous being up on the stage on my own, so I wanna do what I can.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
When I heard those words from Mika-chan, I was so moved~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Woah, Arashi?!
{% endbubble %}

![hi there](https://64.media.tumblr.com/deb1bbc8e4f108d6aeb032918a7a6263/ffd628bc45b1089f-77/s2048x3072/6d69b60389f69e4bb6221363579a7a810fd14398.pnj)

{% bubble Arashi %}
Hi there, Mao-chan. Sorry to bother you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Naru-chan! Did you come here to check up on me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
Yep! You told me yesterday that you were having trouble with something, so I was wondering what happened afterwards.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
I was able to finish the props with no problem and now it's back at my dorm. With Naru-chan's help and advice, I managed to fix it up. Thanks a bunch...~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
Ufufu! That's great to hear. Apart from that, what are you working on now?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
This is the costume's accessory. So far, I think it looks pretty good.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Umm? From the sounds of it, You seem like you’ve been supporting Kagehira's progress this whole time, Arashi.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
Of course, it's a big day for my precious best friend after all. I've been his cheerleader ever since I heard that he was going to have a "feature live".
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Naru-chan's been really supportive of me, so I feel really motivated.

I'll be honest, I can't wait, and I'm a little nervous that I won't be able to make it to the show, but I know I can give it my best. Today I'm definitely going to finish this accessory, then I'll get to working on the next prop...!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
You're really fired up~, I'll be cheering for you too. Buuut, when comparing the sketches and the physical product, isn't it different from "Valkyrie"s typical image?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
Well yeah, it's Mika-chan's live performance, so of course all of Mika-chan's personality be on full display.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Yeah, in that case, it looks super-fresh…I don't know how to word it, but it's good.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Ehehe, it'd make me really happy if I could create something people would view that way. Since I've been thinking a bunch about what a stage decorated with my own special art would look like…
{% endbubble %}

![theres no](https://64.media.tumblr.com/cf0f81bd092c80e0f7f2d321a5d3271b/ffd628bc45b1089f-0a/s2048x3072/f3fc6d3b1cbc343db557a6bf60b35559d2387a4d.pnj)

{% bubble Mika %}
There's no way I could leave anything unfinished or careless. All I want is to take the best I can do and create something that will reach the hearts of the people that come to see it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
...If Mika-chan said he could do it, then I'm positive he can. If there's anything you want me to help you with, then please ask me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Yeah. Thanks a bunch, but it's good enough to have your suggestions and you watching me.

I'll give it my all and make everything for the performance.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
? Did someone's stomach rumble, just now?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
Don't ask me. Are you hungry, Mao-chan?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Well, either way I was gonna buy something, but…

Nn? Kagehira, what're you looking away for?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Th...that was my stomach. Auuugh, that's so embarrassing! After all of that passion and presentation!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
Ufufu, maybe you were too concentrated and got distracted. I think I can pay for Mika-chan's lunch so I can lend him a hand.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Kagehira, what do you want to eat? I was gonna go and take Arashi with me too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Naa, you two don't have to trouble yourselves...!
{% endbubble %}

![well](https://64.media.tumblr.com/cef7516cbe5da7bcda449377fbeefbcc/ffd628bc45b1089f-98/s2048x3072/3aa75329b6b3ed714bc027784b4248734bdabecb.pnj)

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Then, why not eat something made by me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Yuu-kun?!<sup>**(2)**</sup>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
Yuzuru-chan, why are you cooking?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Oh, I see. It's because a few ingredients from the "DIY cooking course" are going to expire soon, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
That's right. Even though there was a student council report, I supposed there was a small chance that some students wouldn’t choose the "DIY course" before the ingredients expired.

Therefore, after hearing what you all were saying, I figured I'd use them myself.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
U-umm, thanks...but, are you sure?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
It would make it so there's no food wasted, so why don't you just accept the kind gesture? If he's cooking from scratch, then he'll be able to make something that suits Mika-chan's tastes.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Since I've already made you lunch boxes before, I already know your food preferences. Please, leave this to me~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
I'm sure the student council will be grateful. I'd honestly be happy eating anything you craft up.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Ufufu. Now then, please wait a few moments. I'll bring the food here to you when it's finished.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Y-yeah… sorry, everyone. For making you do all these things for my sake.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
You want to get that prop done by the end of the day, right?

I'm gonna go give Yuzuru a hand, so you keep at it, Kagehira!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
Everyone here wants to cheer you on, Mika-chan.

For that reason, at times like this you say "thank you".
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Yeah...thank you, really. I'm gonna give it even more of my all to make something good for everyone!
{% endbubble %}

Mika-riiin~

{% bubble Mika %}
Ritsu-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu %}
Are you going back to the dorms? I’ll go with you, so let me carry some things.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Eh, are you sure? These are full of fabric from the art room, so they're pretty heavy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu %}
It's fiiiine, it's fine. Two people are better than one, and three people are better than two. The load will be a lot lighter at that point.

So let's work together and take it easy in order to conserve energy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Three...?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu %}
Oiiii~ is that Corgi I see walking over there? Mika-rin's got trouble because he's carrying a lot of stuff, so help us come carry it~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Koga %}
Ahn? What's up with you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu %}
You were on your way back anyways, Corgi, so make yourself useful for Mika-rin. He’s been working really hard for his "feature live" coming up.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Koga %}
I don't get it. Well, it's obvious you've got a lot of stuff, so I guess I'll help you carry it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Naah! I'm sorry! I'm sorry for all the luggage!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Koga %}
Don't be so uptight, we're all headed to the same place. I'll take this heavy bag and...I'll take that bag for you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu %}
Corgi can be such a gentleman. So then, Mika-rin, I'll pick up that handbag of yours.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Y-yeah...thanks, you two~...

# Chapter 2

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>That evening, when it was just past noon in Paris.

{% bubble Shu %}
—So? How is Kagehira's "feature live" progress coming along?<sup>**(3)**</sup>

You were about to go see how he was doing? But it's already night time over there, you wouldn't be allowed at the dormitories at all, little girl<sup>**(4)**</sup>.

Don't tell me, have you been working at the facility up until now? He's been working in the prop room at ES because you suggested it…fumu. The work environment does affect the work quality, so your concern is appreciated.

I'm planning to return in order to see Kagehira's "feature live" by any means necessary, but I'm so busy preparing an exhibit that I wouldn't be able to leave Paris until just before the performance. I didn't want to interrupt Kagehira, but it's still incredibly frustrating that I can only see glimpses of how things are going through you, little girl.

—I hope he's not too uptight about needing to stand on the stage by himself…Well, please take care and make sure you don't push yourself to work until late at night.

Also, if it's alright, I have a message for you.
{% endbubble %}

![and so](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a421f74061fb0c73f9b9573ed90a7259/acb634fe10fcf621-12/s2048x3072/ee3db78487a4a71d8edda0f139c52205fc2b3a2b.pnj)

{% bubble Shu %}
—And so, I want you to tell that to him. If you find that my words aren't needed, then you don't have to say anything.

...That's all I ask, little girl.

{% bubble Mika %}
Nnnah! Who's there?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
I'm using this room right now. Once you're done with what you need to do then I'm gonna ask you to leave, sorr–

Nn, is that you, Anzu-chan? You surprised me...~ I got scared because I thought someone I didn't know came in here.

But enough about that, come take a look at this. The stuffed animal that I told you I'd stand on stage with, it's starting to come together now~

Thanks to you, Anzu-chan, I can use the prop room. I can spread everything out however I want, and it's nice and quiet in here so I can focus.

Yeah… hm? You're worried that I can't see well in here? I think it's perfect. The lamp has a dim light, which makes me feel relaxed and more able to work. I can't see too well in the dark but… on the other hand, maybe it's because I can only see what's in front of me that I'm more focused than ever.

{% bubble Mika %}
Like this. If I carefully use the needle and thread, I can keep sewing a lot more… Fufu, I'm happy that Anzu-chan praised me for making a cute stuffed animal. I hope that you'll keep looking forward to the finished result, since I'll make sure that I sew it with care until the end.

...Eh, you want to take a photo of me sewing it? Ah, you want to use the picture for the "feature live" pamphlet? Since I left those things to Anzu-chan, I forgot all about it in the end.

Unn…the room is a mess. If anything, wouldn't it be hard to take a picture in such a dark place? Well, if Anzu-chan says it's okay, then I'll trust you. Please take a good picture of me.

Unfufu, I'd say the stuffed animals are happy to hear that Anzu-chan thinks they're cute. On the day of the "feature live", let's do our best~

Unnn, I'm sorry I suddenly got all quiet. I'm trying not to think about it while I work, but I can get nervous in a split second. I ask myself how the live will turn out, and if I can even pull it off well.

Today, Naru-chan, Ritsu-kun. Ikkun, Yuu-kun, and even Oogami-kun all encouraged me.

They all told me they were looking forward to everything, and told me to do my best. I wonder if I can meet their expectations.

I was also hoping to see Oshi-san. Unnn, what would he even say? I wonder if I can make a stage that Oshi-san would recognize, be happy with, and praise. Even just a little bit.

Augh. I can't afford to back out now. On the day of the live, and even while I'm up on stage. I need to keep doing the best that I can–!

Nn? Anzu-chan, what's wrong? You have something you want to tell me?

I have an art form that only I can make, and you hope that I'll have confidence to devote myself to my work with pride… and it's the life that we put into each artwork and the stage that enraptures the audience and makes their hearts flutter—?

Ufufu, what's gotten into you all of a sudden? You're talking like Oshi-san, it's funny hearing you say it.

Nn? What do you mean by "Well, actually..."?! Nneh?! Was that a message from Oshi-san?!

Wait, hang on a sec, what does _that_ mean? He was worried that it would disrupt me if he told me, so Oshi-san told Anzu-chan to relay the message?

Oh... what the hell... it's true that I've been avoiding making phone calls, since I was scared that when I heard his voice I'd get so nervous and determined that I'd get overwhelmed and dizzy, but...now I'm really in a good mood.

Oshi-san probably trusted Anzu-chan with the message because he was positive I can do this.

I'm going to shoo away my insecurities and only trust the words I've gotten from Oshi-san and everyone else!

Anzu-chan, please look forward to it!

As an artist, and as an idol, I'm going to create a stage that nobody else can.

<!-- Translation Notes -->

<h4>Translation Notes</h4>

(1): I'm not really a ValkyrieP so I'm unfamiliar with how translators write out Mika's accent, and just in general I find it really hard to write out accents. To avoid confusing myself I kept it plain and easy, so please forgive leaving it out ^^;

(2): The way Mika refers to Yuzuru. I'm putting this here because I forgot that's what Mika called him so I had to go back and check the wiki and I'm telling myself I'm not the only one that forgot to make myself feel better.

(3): Shu is talking to Anzu over the phone for the duration of the time he's in the chapter.

(4): How Shu refers to Anzu. Adding this for the same reason I added the note for Yuzuru last chapter.
