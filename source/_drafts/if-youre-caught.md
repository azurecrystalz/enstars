  {% bubble Niki %}
    Alright. That's just about it~. We did a pretty good job, don't you think?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Niki-han, you were able to help me get the right shape, thanks a bunch.
    
    Ah, Niki-han. I was too caught up in cooking that I didn't even realize it was getting late. Shouldn't we be heading over to the ES building soon? Today's our costume fitting, isn't it?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Aah, that's right. Shall we get going?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Yeah. I’ll go leave these cookies in my room real quick. I'll be back in a sec.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Hee~eeeyy. Seeing Niki and Kohaku-chan together is so rare!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    We got here together since we met up in the dorms together.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Hm? Is Anzu-han not here yet?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    She was here just a bit ago, but went to go pick up the costumes. She'll surely return soon.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Fuu~n, I got it. Then, I guess I'll just have to wait it out and see. 
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Nn? Ah, it appears that Anzu-san has returned.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Whaddya think, Anzu-chan? Did our costumes turn out nice?
    
    Mm, that's good to hear. "ES Halloween" this year is said to be really spooky. Of course, that would include costumes too wouldn't it?
    
    Right, riiiiight? I'm getting more and more excited for it~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    <th>*(Augh…it's finally time. I'm gonna have to face these costumes now…It looks like they really gave it a lot of effort.)*</th>

    <th>*(I wonder how detailed they're gonna be. There's no telling if it's some sly spirit of mountains or rivers, or some kind of vengeful spirit. Or it could even be some zombie with it's skin rotting till it peels. I really, **really** hope it's not like that.....)*</th>

    <th>*(God, Buddha. I'm begging......!)*</th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Oh? Is that for me? Thannnnks!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Thank you, Anzu-nee-san[^1]!
    
    —Nn? Hmm?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    This is HiMERU's part? Thank you very much.
    
    Oya? …This is…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    <th>*(It'll be okay. Up until now I've done everything I could to prepare for Halloween. I've heard 100 horror stories, watched horror movies, and went to haunted areas at the ES building. Surely I've become immune after all of this training. There's no way it can be as bad as that!)*</th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    ! So this is my costume huh…thanks.
    
    —I wonder what kind of detailed evil spirit of rivers and mountains it's gonna be.
    
    …Wha?! ...This…? Could this be a spider motif?
    
    Ummmm...Anzu-han? I just wanna make sure, this spider theme is "Crazy:B"s costume? So the costumes aren't supposed to replicate sly spirits of mountains or rivers, any kind of vengeful spirit, or zombies from horror movies.....?
  {% endbubble %}

  ![whats funny](https://64.media.tumblr.com/482c2ceb7799f608f391b8b411ab6a05/48b35b4444ef61e1-2a/s2048x3072/89b7e5427261028f8aa115f8685b0b9911bc9798.pnj)

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Eh? What's so funny? Idols’ costumes aren't supposed to be like that? Ahh, I guess so. It makes sense when you think about it.
    
    Doesn't matter how realistic and spooky Halloween is, there is still going to be lives held, so why would they put on makeup that would make it tough to tell if they're even idols at all?
    
    Oh jeez. I suddenly feel lightheaded…I was thinking it was gonna be some kind of scary ghost. I really had no clue what kind of costume I was gonna wear.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    What a relief, Kohaku-chan! Now you can focus on "ES Halloween" without any worries!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    ...Nn? Wait just a minute. Anzu-han, what did you say just now? Could you say it again?
    
    Hmmm? The "units" participating in "ES Halloween" were told what motifs they were going to have beforehand, you say?
    
    ...That so. I was never told anything about that.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    U-uh oh…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Ah. Rinne-kun must've been—
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —Making fun of Oukawa since the beginning, hasn't he?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Wh-what are you saying? I dunno what you're talking about.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![smackdown](https://64.media.tumblr.com/4ce5a418c99384bb5d3fc151668e7284/48b35b4444ef61e1-c1/s2048x3072/ecb39a6329a968735cf0eb31a57a38c4ef26027f.pnj)

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    ...Rinne-han. *(smacks his fists)*

    I'll at least thank you beforehand for helping me get over my weakness.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    ...Uhhh, Kohaku-chan? Why are you smacking your fists together like that?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Prepare yourself!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Shiiiit! Kohaku-chan looks serious about this! Run for it!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Get back here, bastard! I won't let you get away with this!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Ah! Amagi, Oukawa! We haven't finished the costume fitting here yet! Come back!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Annnnd they're gone~
    
    Anzu-nee-san, sorry about that. Could me and HiMERU-kun get our costumes fitted first? Rinne-kun and Kohaku-chan will come back once they get bored, or at least when Rinne-kun gets caught.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —That’s never going to happen. Maybe we should go after them?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    They'll be back~ Aren't we as "Crazy:B" always like that?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    .....Well, that's true. Let's leave them be until they get bored.
    
    Anzu-san, apologies for the inconvenience, but you can start with HiMERU and Shiina first.
  {% endbubble %}

  ### Translation Notes

  [^1]: For ppl who didn't know: this is how Niki usually refers to Anzu. It's usually “Nee-san”/“Anzu-nee-san”, meant to refer to her as like a sister.

  As a note, I think the "IT" in the chapter title is referring to a game of tag, and how the person who's doing the chasing is "it"! So in this chapter, Kohaku running after Rinne is "it" and if Rinne gets caught...well the rest of the chapter title explains that perfectly ^^
